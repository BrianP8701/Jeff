you can change this to a shorter time or a longer time up to 1 hour,
by changing the task timeout setting as described in this page. There is no
explicit timeout on a job execution: when all tasks are done, the job execution
is done.
In the case of retries, the timeout setting applies to each attempt of a task.
If the task attempt does not complete within this time, it will be
stopped.
The units specify a duration; for example, 10m5s is ten minutes
and five seconds. If you don't specify a unit, seconds are assumed as the unit.
For example, the value 10 is 10 seconds.
To specify task timeout for a Cloud Run job:

11,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c4gqd8lz9g1o.amp,Aston Martin: Adrian Newey will join in ¬£30m-a-year deal - BBC Sport,"Image source, Getty Images    Image caption,  Adrian Newey is set to join Aston Martin in 2025        Author,  Andrew Benson     Role,  F1 Correspondent     7 September 2024, 12:45 BST     Leading Formula 1 designer Adrian Newey will join Aston Martin next year. An Aston Martin source told BBC Sport that Newey has made a long-term commitment to the team, said to be a five-year contract worth up to a possible ¬£30m a year, including bonuses and add-ons. The deal will be announced at a news conference organised by Aston Martin at their F1 base at Silverstone on Tuesday. Newey, who in April negotiated an early exit from his contract as Red Bull chief technical officer, will start work in early March. The 65-year-old's manager Eddie Jordan refused to discuss the situation when approached for comment by BBC Sport. An Aston Martin spokesperson said: ""Adrian has been linked to many teams and would be an asset to any team, but we don't have anything to announce."" Securing Newey is a coup for Aston Martin owner Lawrence Stroll after investing heavily in the team with the ambition of turning them into world championship contenders.         Stroll has funded a state-of-the-art new factory, including a wind tunnel, employed a series of top engineers and secured Honda as a works engine partner from 2026. The team also have two-time world champion Fernando Alonso under contract until the end of 2026. Newey has built a reputation as the greatest F1 designer in history after winning 12 drivers‚Äô championships and 13 constructors‚Äô titles in a career that spans the Williams, McLaren and Red Bull teams. In particular, he has a reputation for stealing a march on rivals at the beginning of a period of new regulations. The deal he negotiated to leave Red Bull, to whom he had been under contract until the end of 2025, frees him to join another team in time to have a significant impact on the design they produce for 2026. F1 rules forbid teams from starting design work on the aerodynamics of their 2026 before the start of next year. Newey will be the design lead for a team who have invested heavily in engineering talent in recent years. Former Mercedes engine chief Andy Cowell joins as chief executive officer on 1 October. Aston Martin have signed former Ferrari chassis technical director Enrico Cardile, who will start work in his role as chief technical officer at an unspecified point in 2025. Aston Martin's technical director is Dan Fallows, who joined in April 2022 after working as an aerodynamicist under Newey at Red Bull from 2006 until 2021."

It features many test modes, an account system to save your typing speed history, and user-configurable features such as themes, sounds, a smooth caret, and more. Monkeytype attempts to emulate the experience of natural keyboard typing during a typing test, by unobtrusively presenting the text prompts and displaying typed characters in-place, providing straightforward, real-time feedback on typos, speed, and accuracy.Test yourself in various modes, track your progress and improve your speed.    word set By default, this website uses the most common 200 words in the English language to generate its tests. You can change to an expanded set (1000 most common words) in the options, or change the language entirely.   keybinds You can usetabandenter(or justtabif you have quick tab mode enabled) to restart the typing test. Open the command line by pressingctrl/cmd+shift+poresc- there you can access all the functionality you need without touching your mouse   stats wpm - total amount of characters in the correctly typed words (including spaces), divided by 5 and normalised to 60 seconds. raw wpm - calculated just like wpm, but also includes incorrect words. acc - percentage of correctly pressed keys. char - correct characters / incorrect characters. Calculated after the test has ended. consistency - based on the variance of your raw wpm. Closer to 100% is better. Calculated using the coefficient of variation of raw wpm and mapped onto a scale from 0 to 100.   results screen After completing a test you will be able to see your wpm, raw wpm, accuracy, character stats, test length, leaderboards info and test info. (you can hover over some values to get floating point numbers). You can also see a graph of your wpm and raw over the duration of the test.

If enabled, quick end is recommended.      always show words history This option will automatically show the words history at the end of the test.

Selecting 'flex' allows for this threshold to automatically decrease for longer words.      british english When enabled, the website will use the British spelling instead of American.

Using an incorrect one will count as an error. This feature ignores keys in locationsB,Y, and^because many people use the other hand for those keys. If you're using external software to emulate your layout (including QMK), you should use the ""keymap"" mode - the standard ""on"" will not work. This will enforce opposite shift based on the ""keymap layout"" setting.       stop on error Letter mode will stop input when pressing any incorrect letters. Word mode will not allow you to continue to the next word until you correct all mistakes.      confidence mode When enabled, you will not be able to go back to previous words to fix mistakes. When turned up to the max, you won't be able to backspace at all.      quick end This only applies to the words mode - when enabled, the test will end as soon as the last word has been typed, even if it's incorrect.

I faced the same error.
I had a task to move from one server to another (TFS to Azure), all the repositories, except one, were easily moved using THIS procedure.
One repository, when trying to make a PUSH, threw out such an error.
There are about 15 branches in this repository.
I decided to transfer one branch at a time, using git push url://to/new/repository.git branch-to-move:new-branch-name.
When I applied this option to the master branch, I got the same error.
Then I transferred all other branches (there were no problems with them).
After that, the master branch migrated without problems.

I've faced same error this morning. Upgrading to newer version (2.29.2.windows.2) fixed the issue for me.
Sorry, I didn't have time to take git trace or further investigate this issue. Thus just sharing my experience.

You may try to use the upstream (tracking) reference in your git command, by adding the  -u  option.
 git push -u origin master

32,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17847213/how-to-configure-git-push-to-automatically-set-upstream-without-u,How to configure git push to automatically set upstream without -u? - Stack Overflow,"Short answer 
If you actually like to be explicit and use the -u option when necessary,
but just don't want to type the whole:
 git push -u origin foo
 
Then you can use the following alias:
 [alias]
push-u = !git push -u origin $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
 
And simply type:
 git push-u
 
 Long answer 
Typically, the need for -u (shorthand for --set-upstream) is when we have just created a new local branch and commit, and we want to push it upstream. The remote repository doesn't yet have the new branch, so we need to tell git to create and track the remote branch before pushing the commit. This is only necessary for the first push on the branch. Here is a typical scenario:
 git checkout -b foo # Create local branch
git commit -m ""Foo"" # Create local commit
git push -u origin foo # Create and track remote branch, and push commit
git commit -m ""Bar"" # Create local commit
git push # Push commit
 
Personally, I do like the need to be explicit with git push -u when creating the remote branch: it's a pretty significant operation, sharing a whole new branch to the world.
However, I hate that we have to explicitly write git push -u origin foo. Not only it is a pain to type, but more importantly, it's quite error-prone! It's easy to make a mistake when typing the branch name, and the new remote branch won't have the same name as your local branch! In most cases, really, you want the upstream repository to be origin, and the upstream branch to have the same name as your local branch.
Therefore, I'm using the following alias in my .gitconfig, which is a subset of the excellent answer provided by Mark:
 [alias]
push-u = !git push -u origin $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
 
Now, we can do the following, which is still explicit, but less error-prone:
 git checkout -b foo # Create local branch
git commit -m ""Foo"" # Create local commit
git push-u # Create and track remote branch, and push commit
git commit -m ""Bar"" # Create local commit
git push # Push commit"

We have one client that uses our older API to query the database to fetch thousands of records once a day.
I would say close to the top end of the thousands.
The API is currently on a compute engine behind a load balancer and during the allotted time I spin up 6 instances of this to attempt to help handle the load.
What I have found is that the CPU usage on cloud SQL is maxing out at 100% and most of the other stats are fine, it's just the CPU.
This basically renders our API useless as we can't accept connections and it just shits its self.
What can we do to help this?
Here is the CPU utilisation chart
  
And the connections
  
Read/Writes
  
Memory Usage
  
You can see in most of the other charts the readings are well within normal for what we expect.
I don't really want to have to beef up the CPU usage if it isn't really the actual underlining problem.
A further thing to note is we have developed a new endpoint for this client specifically to use, they have not got that in place yet, and there is no guarantee that it will reduce the db load."

For some reason I cannot get the optimizer to parallelize the first query. So I just materialize some huge tables (~400k rows) and loop join them.

I've talked at length in How to analyse SQL Server performance about why practically your query never 'executes': is always waiting on something (IO, locks).
To create a workload that drives 100% CPU, even on one core, is no small feat. You need to make sure your query always execute and never waits. Never blocks for IO (all data must be in memory), never blocks for locks (no contention), never blocks for memory (no grant). You should look as scans of hot in-memory data. An artificial, totally bogus, workload that achieves this would probably self-join a medium size table many times.
Now if you want to do this with a realistic workload, including various operations, then good luck. Achieving 100% CPU is basically the benchmarks golden standard. You need super performant IO subsystem to eliminate all waits and you need very fancy test driver to be able to feed the workload fast enough, without creating contention.

I think the better way for keeping CPU busy is using POWER function in all compilers
 DECLARE @T DATETIME, @F BIGINT;
SET @T = GETDATE();
WHILE DATEADD(SECOND,60,@T)&gt;GETDATE()
SET @F=POWER(2,30);
 
You can make several query run at same time depends your CPU capacity
Take a look at this link below (Original article)

The idea comes from usr, to makes it a little more general, no SQL Server peculiar things used, so you can use it for any kind of DB/DM. Also there is no write, which will avoid the I/O affect.
Need to select a big use or system table ""table1"" at first.
If this table has record N, following query produces O(N^4) complexity which optimizer cannot improve it.
 with t1 as
(
select
d1.f1 as i1, d2.f1 as i2, d3.f1 as i3, d3.f2 as f2
from
table1 d1
inner join
table1 d2 on d1.f1 &lt; d2.f1
inner join
table1 d3 on d2.f1 &lt; d3.f1
order by
f2
)
select
avg(sin(o1.i1)) + avg(cos(o2.i1))
from
t1 o1
join
t1 o2 on o1.i1 &lt; o2.i1

I've read about supporting this feature in the future and there's some discussion about it. However, for specific reasons, I need a solution for this problem. So what I did is a script that runs periodically: 
1) Based on locks and activity, query in order to retrieve processID of the transactions that is taking too long, and keeping the oldest (trxTimeOut.sql):
 SELECT procpid
FROM
(
SELECT DISTINCT age(now(), query_start) AS age, procpid
FROM pg_stat_activity, pg_locks
WHERE pg_locks.pid = pg_stat_activity.procpid
) AS foo
WHERE age &gt; '30 seconds'
ORDER BY age DESC
LIMIT 1
 
2) Based on this query, kill the corresponding process (trxTimeOut.sh):
 psql -h localhost -U postgres -t -d test_database -f trxTimeOut.sql | xargs kill
 
Although I've tested it and seems to work, I'd like to know if it's an acceptable approach or should I consider a different one?"

46,https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/10218,prisma.$transaction: Benchmark produces unexpected results ¬∑ Issue #10218 ¬∑ prisma/prisma,"In addition to this, for anyone interested, I did some benchmarking on transactions on my side as well, when trying to track down connections pools issues prior to 3.13.0.
In my bench, I only tested transactions and their overhead over performances. In two different contexts:
(All done with prisma default connection pool config and timeout times, and basic postgres instance on my dev machine)
One transaction performing many inserts (long transaction, one at a time).
Many transactions performing 2 inserts each (short transactions, but many at once).
For what I observed, this is my TL;DR:
The performance cost of using transactions by itself is quite minimal, in fact, when using array transactions to do many inserts inside a single transaction we gain a little on the performance side. With interactive transactions, when they don't fail, the cost is a few milisecs over ~5-6 secs of total time.
Basically, array transactions can handle twice as much load than ""interactives"" one in both tests.
In testing context 1:
- array transactions (pass in all the bench tests)
- interactives transactions (fail due to expired/timeout on the last test with 1280 rows inserted at once)
In texting context 2:
array transactions work with up to 640 concurrent requests, then some timeout due to ""acquire"" transaction time too long.
interactives transactions fail between ""160"" and ""320"" concurrent requests.
So if you hit performances issues with transactions, it'll be likely due to either:
Your connexion pool isn't enough to handle the load of concurrent requests on your app. (Transaction acquire timeout error).
Your transaction itself takes too long to execute and ends up in timeout because of default timeout values. (Transaction expired, timeout error).
You can found the code of the bench here: here it's done with ""my code specific"" but the logic should apply in every situations."

We designed Insights using open standards, with world-class visualizations and with modern architectures such as microservices in mind.  We want all database customers to make the most of their deployments, so we've made Insights available at no additional cost for the most recent week of history‚Äîthe last 7 days of metrics will be displayed in the dashboard. Insights is now available for Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.   Why are all my developers waiting for their turn with the DBA?  Application development teams are shipping features faster than ever before. What was once an event a few times a year has shifted to a DevOps model with multiple ships a week, or even many times a day. In addition, there are more application users spread around the globe, continuously driving workloads on your applications. When performance issues arise, it‚Äôs oftentimes the database that is the root cause.  With DevOps, more ownership of the full development lifecycle has moved to software developers. However, for database performance, developers may not have the skills or tools to solve problems themselves. If they turn to DBAs for help, they are likely to find they are waiting their turn: DBAs are highly outnumbered and have become a scarce resource in virtually every organization. Urgent performance issues in production applications can go unresolved, leaving customers with a poor experience. Insights helps developers address database performance themselves, allowing for faster iteration on your applications and freeing your DBAs to work on more strategic tasks. ‚ÄúThe number of apps we manage and the frequency at which we release features has increased dramatically with the cloud,‚Äù said Greg Cain, MLB Vice President, Baseball Data. ‚ÄúThis makes it harder for our DBA team to keep up with performance problems. Cloud SQL Insights should help us overcome this with self-service monitoring and diagnosis for our application developers and engineers who will be able to proactively prevent query performance problems.‚Äù    Database observability across the development life cycle with open standards  Insights complements your existing APM and observability tools. Insights provides database metrics and traces through the open standard OpenTelemetry and Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Trace APIs. This makes it easy to do end-to-end tracing in your existing tools and provides a full-stack view of your environments from the application through the database.  ‚ÄúAs organizations are increasingly adopting managed database services in the cloud, they‚Äôre asking for better observability into their application environments,‚Äù says Steve Tack, SVP of Product Management at Dynatrace. ‚ÄúWe are pleased to combine Dynatrace‚Äôs AI-powered observability with the open standards of Cloud SQL Insights to help enterprises run applications with the highest reliability and performance.‚Äú  Application-centric database monitoring using query tags  Traditional monitoring tools provide a query-centric view of performance. This limitation can create a disconnect between performance and application code, especially with modern architectures like MVC and microservices.  Insights provides developers with database monitoring through the lens of the application. Developers can use tags to associate queries with specific business functions, such as payment, inventory, business analytics, and shipping. Developers can then quickly evaluate the database load contributed by specific microservices or user flows, for example. Developers simply add tags to their application code:   And use Insights for a holistic view of performance organized by business function rather than by query. Here‚Äôs a look at database load sorted by tags:        Click to enlarge    ORMs are used in most applications to simplify database query development. One of the drawbacks of ORMs is that they can generate inefficient queries that are very difficult to diagnose. Insights provides SQL Commenter, an open-source library that auto-instruments your ORMs to help identify which application code is causing problems. Once installed, SQL Commenter automatically tags queries, alleviating the need to make any changes to application code. SQL Commenter supports many popular ORMs such as Hibernate, Spring, Express, Django, Flask, and others. Learn more about SQL Commenter.          Self-service experience for query diagnostics   With Insights, developers can seamlessly move from detection to diagnosis using a single interface. Insights helps identify query performance problems early with pre-built dashboards. Here‚Äôs an example:        Click to enlarge    Visual query plans give insights into the root cause of performance problems:        Click to enlarge    Insights is serverless. It manages the collection of telemetry for diagnostics with minimum performance impact, reducing the time you spend managing monitoring infrastructure. All performance metrics are protected by Google Cloud‚Äôs enterprise-class security, privacy, and compliance.

56,https://serverfault.com/questions/284799/postgres-disk-io-very-high-what-can-i-do-to-reduce-it-immediately,linux - Postgres DISK IO very high. What can I do to reduce it immediately? - Server Fault,"The 24MB shared_buffers setting is the conservative default, I'd say it needs to be quite a lot higher for a dedicated database with 16GB of RAM available. But yes, you'll have to restart the server to resize it. http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Performance_Optimization is a good place to start for performance configuration guidelines. Setting the shared_buffers to 4GB or 6GB would seem more reasonable.
Note that on linux you need to adjust the kernel.shmmax sysctl setting (in /etc/sysctl.conf or just by writing /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax) to allocate a block of this much shared memory. If you don't you'll get an error specifying how much was requested, you have to set kernel.shmmax higher than that.
Since you have lots of memory, you might also consider setting the default work_mem higher, which will make things like sorts and hashes (group/order/distinct etc) tend to work in memory rather than using temp files. You don't need to restart the server to do this, just update the config file, reload the service and new sessions will get the new setting. The default work memory for a session is 1MB, you can calculate the maximum that may be used at a single time as work_mem * max_client_connections and estimate what impact that will have.
You should also increase effective_cache_size to indicate to the planner that the kernel FS layer is likely to be caching a lot of pages in memory outside of postgresql's shared buffers.
etc. etc. hope this gets you off to a good start."

If you need more tokens, you can always request a quota increase.
Frequently Asked Questions
What‚Äôs a token?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
You can think of tokens as pieces of words used for natural language processing. For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words. As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.
To learn more about how tokens work and estimate your usage‚Ä¶
Experiment with our interactive Tokenizer tool.
Log in to your account and enter text into the Playground. The counter in the footer will display how many tokens are in your text.
Which model should I use?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
While Davinci is generally the most capable model, the other models can perform certain tasks extremely well and, in some cases, significantly faster. They also have cost advantages. For example, Curie can perform many of the same tasks as Davinci, but faster and for 1/10th the cost. We encourage developers to experiment to find the model that‚Äôs most efficient for your application. Visit our documentation for a more detailed model comparison.
How will I know how many tokens I‚Äôve used each month?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
Log in to your account to view your usage tracking dashboard. This page will show you how many tokens you‚Äôve used during the current and past billing cycles.
How can I manage my spending?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
You can configure a usage hard limit in your billing settings, after which we‚Äôll stop serving your requests. You may also configure a soft limit to receive an email alert once you pass a certain usage threshold. There may be a delay in enforcing the limit, and you are responsible for any overage incurred. We recommend checking your usage tracking dashboard regularly to monitor your spend.
Does Playground usage count against my quota?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
Yes, we treat Playground usage the same as regular API usage.
How is pricing calculated for Completions?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
 Completions requests are billed based on the number of tokens sent in your prompt plus the number of tokens in the completion(s) returned by the API.
The best_of and n parameters may also impact costs. Because these parameters generate multiple completions per prompt, they act as multipliers on the number of tokens returned.
Your request may use up to num_tokens(prompt) + max_tokens * max(n, best_of) tokens, which will be billed at the per-engine rates outlined at the top of this page.
In the simplest case, if your prompt contains 10 tokens and you request a single 90 token completion from the davinci engine, your request will use 100 tokens and will cost $0.002.
You can limit costs by reducing prompt length or maximum response length, limiting usage of best_of/n, adding appropriate stop sequences, or using engines with lower per-token costs.
How is pricing calculated for Fine-tuning?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
There are two components to fine-tuning pricing: training and usage.
When training a fine-tuned model, the total tokens used will be billed according to our training rates. Note that the number of training tokens depends on the number of tokens in your training dataset and your chosen number of training epochs. The default number of epochs is 4.
(Tokens in your training file * Number of training epochs) = Total training tokens
 
Once you fine-tune a model, you‚Äôll be billed only for the tokens you use. Requests sent to fine-tuned models are billed at our usage rates.
How is pricing calculated for Classifications?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
 Classifications requests are billed based on the number of tokens in the inputs you provide. Internally this endpoint makes calls to the search and completions endpoints, so its costs are a function of the costs of those endpoints.
The actual cost per token is based upon which models you select to perform both the search and the completion, which are controlled by the search_model and model parameters respectively.
You may provide a file containing the examples to search over, or you can explicitly specify examples in your request. Providing a file makes search faster and more cost effective when the number of examples you‚Äôd like to search over is greater than max_examples. In this scenario, costs are largely based on the number of examples reranked (controlled by max_examples) and the total length of those examples. If you pass examples in your request instead, costs are based on the total length of all those examples.
The length of the query passed into the model as well as the final classification label that is generated will also factor into costs.

Because this technology is new, we also want to make sure that rollouts are done responsibly. When you sign up, you‚Äôll be granted an initial spend limit, or quota, and we‚Äôll increase that limit over time as you build a track record with your application. If you need more tokens, you can always request a quota increase.
Frequently Asked Questions
What‚Äôs a token?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
You can think of tokens as pieces of words used for natural language processing. For English text, 1 token is approximately 4 characters or 0.75 words. As a point of reference, the collected works of Shakespeare are about 900,000 words or 1.2M tokens.
To learn more about how tokens work and estimate your usage‚Ä¶
Experiment with our interactive Tokenizer tool.
Log in to your account and enter text into the Playground. The counter in the footer will display how many tokens are in your text.
Which model should I use?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
While Davinci is generally the most capable model, the other models can perform certain tasks extremely well and, in some cases, significantly faster. They also have cost advantages. For example, Curie can perform many of the same tasks as Davinci, but faster and for 1/10th the cost. We encourage developers to experiment to find the model that‚Äôs most efficient for your application. Visit our documentation for a more detailed model comparison.
How will I know how many tokens I‚Äôve used each month?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
Log in to your account to view your usage tracking dashboard. This page will show you how many tokens you‚Äôve used during the current and past billing cycles.
How can I manage my spending?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
You can configure a usage hard limit in your billing settings, after which we‚Äôll stop serving your requests. You may also configure a soft limit to receive an email alert once you pass a certain usage threshold. There may be a delay in enforcing the limit, and you are responsible for any overage incurred. We recommend checking your usage tracking dashboard regularly to monitor your spend.
Does Playground usage count against my quota?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
Yes, we treat Playground usage the same as regular API usage.
How is pricing calculated for Completions?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
 Completions requests are billed based on the number of tokens sent in your prompt plus the number of tokens in the completion(s) returned by the API.
The best_of and n parameters may also impact costs. Because these parameters generate multiple completions per prompt, they act as multipliers on the number of tokens returned.
Your request may use up to num_tokens(prompt) + max_tokens * max(n, best_of) tokens, which will be billed at the per-engine rates outlined at the top of this page.
In the simplest case, if your prompt contains 10 tokens and you request a single 90 token completion from the davinci engine, your request will use 100 tokens and will cost $0.002.
You can limit costs by reducing prompt length or maximum response length, limiting usage of best_of/n, adding appropriate stop sequences, or using engines with lower per-token costs.
How is pricing calculated for Fine-tuning?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
There are two components to fine-tuning pricing: training and usage.
When training a fine-tuned model, the total tokens used will be billed according to our training rates. Note that the number of training tokens depends on the number of tokens in your training dataset and your chosen number of training epochs. The default number of epochs is 4.
(Tokens in your training file * Number of training epochs) = Total training tokens
 
Once you fine-tune a model, you‚Äôll be billed only for the tokens you use. Requests sent to fine-tuned models are billed at our usage rates.
How is pricing calculated for Classifications?
navigatedown
navigateup
 
 
 Classifications requests are billed based on the number of tokens in the inputs you provide. Internally this endpoint makes calls to the search and completions endpoints, so its costs are a function of the costs of those endpoints.
The actual cost per token is based upon which models you select to perform both the search and the completion, which are controlled by the search_model and model parameters respectively.
You may provide a file containing the examples to search over, or you can explicitly specify examples in your request. Providing a file makes search faster and more cost effective when the number of examples you‚Äôd like to search over is greater than max_examples. In this scenario, costs are largely based on the number of examples reranked (controlled by max_examples) and the total length of those examples. If you pass examples in your request instead, costs are based on the total length of all those examples.
The length of the query passed into the model as well as the final classification label that is generated will also factor into costs.

134,https://www.datacenters.com/news/what-is-a-vcpu-and-how-do-you-calculate-vcpu-to-cpu,What is a vCPU and How Do You Calculate vCPU to CPU?,"What is a vCPU, or virtual processor, and how does it compare to a CPU? It‚Äôs the number one question that we receive from customers interested in purchasing cloud servers or bare metal. 
In this article, we‚Äôll examine what a vCPU is as well as the differences between vCPUs and traditional CPUs. We‚Äôll also look at the mathematics behind vCPUs and how to calculate the number of vCPUs and cores. Quick hint, it‚Äôs not as easy as one core equals one vCPU.
 What is a vCPU? 
Before we get started, what is a vCPU? vCPU is the abbreviation for virtual centralized processing unit. As for a definition, a vCPU represents a portion or share of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a particular virtual machine (VM).
 Related Terms You Should Know 
Next, let‚Äôs review a few more terms and definitions relating to virtual servers. They include hypervisor, socket, thread, physical core, and logical core. Feel free to skip ahead to How Does a vCPU Work? or How Do You Calculate vCPU? 
 Hypervisor 
What is a hypervisor? Think of a hypervisor as a controller. It‚Äôs sometimes referred to as a virtual machine monitor (VMM). Simply put, a hypervisor is software used to create and run virtual machines (VMs). It allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources such as memory and processing. Hypervisors are smart enough to allocate resources whether a single vCPU or numerous vCPUs.
 Socket 
What is a socket? When you see the term socket, I want you to think of hardware. I want you to imagine the number of sockets in a motherboard. A socket is an array of pins that hold a processor in place and connect the motherboard to the available processing power. The number of sockets is determined by the capacity of the motherboard.
There are differences in sockets depending on which generation CPU is supported.
 Thread 
What is a thread? A thread is a path of execution within a process. A process contains one or more threads. What‚Äôs the difference between a thread and a process? The primary difference is that threads within the same process run in shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.
A thread is also known as a lightweight process. The concept of parallelism is to divide a process into multiple threads. As an example, having multiple tabs open in a browser represents different threads. For word processing, there can be multiple threads such as one for formatting text and another thread for processing inputs.
 Physical Core 
What is a physical core? A physical core, also referred to as processing units, within the CPU. A single physical core may correspond to one or more logical cores. We will get to what a logical core is in the next paragraph.
 Logical Core 
What is a logical core? A logical core makes it possible for a single physical core to perform two or more actions simultaneously. Logical cores came from the early days of Intel Xeon server processors and Pentium 4 desktop processors which were released in 2002.
Logical cores made the concept of hyper-threading (HTT) possible. Hyper-threading is Intel's proprietary simultaneous multithreading implementation and was used to improve parallelization of computations performed on x86 microprocessors.
Why is hyper-threading important to virtualization? Before HTT, the sub-components of the core were not to be being used for certain types of instructions and could have been used for long-running instruction. HTT made it possible for the CPU to work on two tasks simultaneously.
Newer cores are more like full-fledged CPUs so they‚Äôre capable of working on multiple tasks simultaneously. However, they‚Äôre not true CPUs as the physical cores are. There are limitations to hyper-threading versus the physical capabilities of the core.
 How Does a vCPU Work? 
How does a vCPU work? Virtual servers and their resource allocation are controlled by what is known as a hypervisor. We defined hypervisor in more detail above.
The hypervisor uses a portion of the physical CPU computing resources and allocates it to a vCPU which is assigned to a specific VM. Some IT experts consider the concept behind vCPUs as a share of the time spent on the processor‚Äôs core. System administrators can use hypervisors to setup different resource allocations where specific VMs are configured with specific vCPU capabilities.
 How Do You Calculate vCPU? 
How do you calculate vCPU? How many vCPU are in a CPU? What are cores? These questions can be somewhat unclear for those unfamiliar with virtualized servers. Don‚Äôt worry. We‚Äôll go into detail on the mathematics and you‚Äôll have a clear idea of how to calculate the number of vCPUs that you require for your cloud servers. A lot of this will depend on your specific requirements and the manufacturer.
 The Math Behind Calculating vCPU 
In the past, there was a rule of thumb that there were eight vCPUs per core. Today, vCPU count is largely determined by the manufacturer. It‚Äôs calculated by taking the number of processing threads that a chipset offers per core and multiplying the number of occupied sockets. Here‚Äôs how it looks:
 (Threads x Cores) x Physical CPU = Number vCPU 
 Example Calculation of vCPU &amp; Cores 
The best way to learn how to calculate vCPU and cores is to demonstrate through an example.
First, we need to select a virtual server and CPU. For this example, we‚Äôll select Intel Xeon E-2288G as the underlying CPU. Key stats for the Intel Xeon E-2288G include 8 cores / 16 threads with a 3.7GHz base clock and 5.0GHz turbo boost. There is 16MB of onboard cache.
 (16 Threads x 8 Cores) x 1 CPU = 128 vCPU 
 Determine Your Workload &amp; Utilization 
That‚Äôs not all. How do you know where to start? First, you need to know your workload and application profiles. We can help you analyze this. Click here to contact us.
A few questions to consider before you get started? Do your apps run at 100% CPU utilization all of the time? Do they have periods where utilization bursts? Do they have maintenance windows? By knowing your requirements, you can make an informed decision on the underlying hardware.
Theoretically, if you have small VMs that barely use any CPU time, you could easily get 20-30 VMs from an 8-core server. However, if you have larger workloads such as a database server, you will have far fewer VMs from that same 8 core server. It‚Äôs all about resource utilization and allocation.
Next, let‚Äôs look at some different configuration options. We are doing this just as an example and your vCPU allocation to each VM will depend on your specific workload.
 4 vCPUs per VM 128 vCPUs/4 vCPUs per VM = 32 VMs
 2 vCPUs per VM 128 vCPUs/2 vCPUs per VM = 64 VMs
 1 vCPUs per VM 128 vCPUs/1 vCPUs per VM = 128 VMs
 CPU Exhaustion &amp; Poor Performance 
There is such as a thing as CPU exhaustion which can cause poor performance for your virtual machines. The number of virtual cores assigned to a VM is limited.
For example, Windows Server 2008 R2 limits the number of vCPUs as 4 per VM which is extended to 64 in Windows server 2012.

136,https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html,PostgreSQL: Documentation: 16: 20.4.¬†Resource Consumption,"shared_buffers (integer)   
Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The default is typically 128 megabytes (128MB), but might be less if your kernel settings will not support it (as determined during initdb). This setting must be at least 128 kilobytes. However, settings significantly higher than the minimum are usually needed for good performance. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. (Non-default values of BLCKSZ change the minimum value.) This parameter can only be set at server start.
If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a reasonable starting value for shared_buffers is 25% of the memory in your system. There are some workloads where even larger settings for shared_buffers are effective, but because PostgreSQL also relies on the operating system cache, it is unlikely that an allocation of more than 40% of RAM to shared_buffers will work better than a smaller amount. Larger settings for shared_buffers usually require a corresponding increase in max_wal_size, in order to spread out the process of writing large quantities of new or changed data over a longer period of time.
On systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage of RAM is appropriate, so as to leave adequate space for the operating system.
 huge_pages (enum)   
Controls whether huge pages are requested for the main shared memory area. Valid values are try (the default), on, and off. With huge_pages set to try, the server will try to request huge pages, but fall back to the default if that fails. With on, failure to request huge pages will prevent the server from starting up. With off, huge pages will not be requested.
At present, this setting is supported only on Linux and Windows. The setting is ignored on other systems when set to try. On Linux, it is only supported when shared_memory_type is set to mmap (the default).
The use of huge pages results in smaller page tables and less CPU time spent on memory management, increasing performance. For more details about using huge pages on Linux, see Section 19.4.5.
Huge pages are known as large pages on Windows. To use them, you need to assign the user right ‚ÄúLock pages in memory‚Äù to the Windows user account that runs PostgreSQL. You can use Windows Group Policy tool (gpedit.msc) to assign the user right ‚ÄúLock pages in memory‚Äù. To start the database server on the command prompt as a standalone process, not as a Windows service, the command prompt must be run as an administrator or User Access Control (UAC) must be disabled. When the UAC is enabled, the normal command prompt revokes the user right ‚ÄúLock pages in memory‚Äù when started.
Note that this setting only affects the main shared memory area. Operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, and Illumos can also use huge pages (also known as ‚Äúsuper‚Äù pages or ‚Äúlarge‚Äù pages) automatically for normal memory allocation, without an explicit request from PostgreSQL. On Linux, this is called ‚Äútransparent huge pages‚Äù  (THP). That feature has been known to cause performance degradation with PostgreSQL for some users on some Linux versions, so its use is currently discouraged (unlike explicit use of huge_pages).
 huge_page_size (integer)   
Controls the size of huge pages, when they are enabled with huge_pages. The default is zero (0). When set to 0, the default huge page size on the system will be used. This parameter can only be set at server start.
Some commonly available page sizes on modern 64 bit server architectures include: 2MB and 1GB (Intel and AMD), 16MB and 16GB (IBM POWER), and 64kB, 2MB, 32MB and 1GB (ARM). For more information about usage and support, see Section 19.4.5.
Non-default settings are currently supported only on Linux.
 temp_buffers (integer)   
Sets the maximum amount of memory used for temporary buffers within each database session. These are session-local buffers used only for access to temporary tables. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as blocks, that is BLCKSZ bytes, typically 8kB. The default is eight megabytes (8MB). (If BLCKSZ is not 8kB, the default value scales proportionally to it.) This setting can be changed within individual sessions, but only before the first use of temporary tables within the session; subsequent attempts to change the value will have no effect on that session.
A session will allocate temporary buffers as needed up to the limit given by temp_buffers. The cost of setting a large value in sessions that do not actually need many temporary buffers is only a buffer descriptor, or about 64 bytes, per increment in temp_buffers. However if a buffer is actually used an additional 8192 bytes will be consumed for it (or in general, BLCKSZ bytes).
 max_prepared_transactions (integer)   
Sets the maximum number of transactions that can be in the ‚Äúprepared‚Äù state simultaneously (see PREPARE TRANSACTION). Setting this parameter to zero (which is the default) disables the prepared-transaction feature. This parameter can only be set at server start.
If you are not planning to use prepared transactions, this parameter should be set to zero to prevent accidental creation of prepared transactions. If you are using prepared transactions, you will probably want max_prepared_transactions to be at least as large as max_connections, so that every session can have a prepared transaction pending.
When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to the same or higher value than on the primary server. Otherwise, queries will not be allowed in the standby server.
 work_mem (integer)   
Sets the base maximum amount of memory to be used by a query operation (such as a sort or hash table) before writing to temporary disk files. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. The default value is four megabytes (4MB). Note that for a complex query, several sort or hash operations might be running in parallel; each operation will generally be allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before it starts to write data into temporary files. Also, several running sessions could be doing such operations concurrently. Therefore, the total memory used could be many times the value of work_mem; it is necessary to keep this fact in mind when choosing the value. Sort operations are used for ORDER BY, DISTINCT, and merge joins. Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, result cache nodes and hash-based processing of IN subqueries.
Hash-based operations are generally more sensitive to memory availability than equivalent sort-based operations. The memory available for hash tables is computed by multiplying work_mem by hash_mem_multiplier. This makes it possible for hash-based operations to use an amount of memory that exceeds the usual work_mem base amount.
 hash_mem_multiplier (floating point)   
Used to compute the maximum amount of memory that hash-based operations can use. The final limit is determined by multiplying work_mem by hash_mem_multiplier. The default value is 2.0, which makes hash-based operations use twice the usual work_mem base amount.
Consider increasing hash_mem_multiplier in environments where spilling by query operations is a regular occurrence, especially when simply increasing work_mem results in memory pressure (memory pressure typically takes the form of intermittent out of memory errors). The default setting of 2.0 is often effective with mixed workloads. Higher settings in the range of 2.0 - 8.0 or more may be effective in environments where work_mem has already been increased to 40MB or more.
 maintenance_work_mem (integer)   
Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as kilobytes. It defaults to 64 megabytes (64MB). Since only one of these operations can be executed at a time by a database session, and an installation normally doesn't have many of them running concurrently, it's safe to set this value significantly larger than work_mem. Larger settings might improve performance for vacuuming and for restoring database dumps.
Note that when autovacuum runs, up to autovacuum_max_workers times this memory may be allocated, so b"

138,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60147360/what-is-the-ideal-number-of-max-connections-for-a-postgres-database,postgresql - What is the ideal number of max connections for a postgres database? - Stack Overflow,"The number of concurrent connections should be large enough for the number of concurrent running queries or transactions you may have.
If you have a lower limit, then new queries/transactions will have to wait for an available connection.
You may want to monitor currently running queries (see pg_stat_activity for instance) to detect such issues.
However, your database server must be able to handle the number of connections. If you are using a server provided by a third party, it may have set limits. If you are using your own server, then it needs to be configured properly.
Note that to handle more connections, your database server will need more processes and more RAM. Also, if they are long running queries (as opposed to transactions), then you are most probably resource-constrained on the server (often I/O-bound), and adding more queries running at the same time usually won't help with overall performance. You may want to look at configuration of your DB server (buffers etc.), and of course, if you haven't already done so, optimise your queries (make sure they all use indexes). The other pg_stat_* views and EXPLAIN are your friends here.
If you have long-running transactions with lots of idle time, then more concurrent connections may help, though you may have to wonder why you have such long-running transactions.

 Check the immediate state of your database server using pg_stat_activity and friends. 
 If you don't already have that, set up monitoring of I/O, CPU, memory, swap, postgresql statistics over time. This will give you a clearer picture of what is going on on your server. If you don't have that, you're just running blind. 
 If you have long-running transactions, check that you always correctly release transactions/connections, including when errors occur. This is a pretty common issue with node.js-based web servers. Make sure you use try .. catch blocks wherever needed. 
 If there are any long-running queries, check that they are properly optimised (using indexes). If not, do your utmost to optimise them. This will be the single most useful step you can take if that's were the issue is. 
 If they are properly optimised and you have enough spare resources (RAM, I/O...), then you can consider raising the number of connections. Otherwise it's just pointless. 
Edit
Since you are not operating the database yourself, you won't necessarily have all the visibility you could have on resource usage.
However, you can still:
Check pg_stat_activity. This alone will tell you a lot of things.
Check for connections/transactions that are kept around when they shouldn't
Check queries are properly optimised
GCP has a default maximum concurrent connections limit set to 100 for instances with 3.75 GiB of RAM. So you could indeed increase the size of your pool. But if any of the above issues are present, you are just delaying or moving the issue a bit further, so start by checking those and fixing them if relevant."

174,https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/273887/is-it-always-bad-to-have-long-running-transactions-or-is-this-case-ok,"postgresql - Is it *always* bad to have long-running transactions, or is this case OK? - Database Administrators Stack Exchange","This is nothing fundamentally wrong with this, is it? Even though the transaction takes a long time before it finally commits,
The risk is locks. Only one transaction can update a given row at a time. There can be various reasons for this. A few easy to understand cases are:
Update statements which depend on the current state, such as update blah set count = count + 1. What would happen if two processes each read a row with count = 4, they each add 1, which produces 5, and they both write 5? One of them had their results corrupted.
Indexes - select first_name, last_name from users where last_name = 'Jones'; - imagine there is an index on last_name. Great! We can optimize the query by scanning the index, then for each row, go out to the table and retrieve the two columns. Imagine a transaction updated the table, but had not yet updated the index, then we come along and suddenly select first_name, last_name from users where last_name = 'Jones'; returns Jane Doe. Indexes are expected to be consistent with the table.
Cascading deletes - if table B defines a foreign key constraint referring to table A with on delete cascade, what happens if you query table B before the cascade delete has happened?
The solution to all of these problems, and more, is locking. Postgres will lock the row for any updates to it so that any other updates to that row have to wait for the lock to be released. When running in a transaction, locks continue to be held until the transaction is committed or rolled back.
It seems to me that it's guaranteed that I will be able to SELECT from the table while this transaction block is running, but is it also possible to INSERT and DELETE and UPDATE?
In PostgreSQL, I believe that is correct.
My brain cannot comprehend how exactly the database would handle this. Is this what a deadlock is?
A deadlock is when multiple transactions, running concurrently, each require the same locks, but request them in a different order.
Process A wants to lock rows X and Y. Process B wants to lock rows Y and X. They each go ahead. Process A locks row X and process B locks row Y. Now what do they do? They enter a state where they wait for each other. Because they each are waiting on each other, neither makes progress, so they wait forever. That is what creates the ""dead"" in deadlock. The processes will appear to be dead because they are sleeping forever.
Or will they continue INSERTing and UPDATEing and DELETING from a ""ghost table"" and all changes are lost when the long-running transaction finally COMMITs? That doesn't sound right. I assume that it would refuse any ""changing"" operation to the table while that transaction is running, correct?
Selects should work fine because what happens with insert, update, and delete, is Postgres creates new versions of the rows and keeps track of which transactions see which versions. If you're not in a transaction and simply select a row, you should see the last committed version of the row at the time you query it. Inserts, updates, and deletes, however, will block, waiting in line for their turn.
Nothing should error. To a reasonable degree, blocking is normal. Blocking is the database protecting your data. However, blocking is a scalability problem because it means only 1 transaction at a time can change something. Like all performance concerns, it's a question of your workload and what tradeoffs you can tolerate. Blocking is a common problem encountered when troubleshooting database performance.
So what's the problem with long-running transactions?
Any rows updated in a transaction may cause other transactions to wait. Those transactions may also be holding locks, and now they are stalled, which may cause them to block others. This pattern leads to blocking chains and in an OLTP workload, can degrade performance substantially.
The premise is simple: Hold as few locks as you need for as short of a time as possible.
What to do in your case?
It depends. Is the truncate statement being run in production or only in test environments? Are there foreign keys involved?
It's odd that the inserts would take so long for you. Can you batch them into a single statement or keep the rows in a second table and after truncate, do a insert into test select ... from second_table?
It really depends on what problem it's causing you, if any. If the table isn't used by most of your queries, then maybe your transaction is just fine. If you're getting blocking issues (issue defined as something impacting users) in production, then you should try to optimize the inserts."

All 100 prisoners are perfect logicians. They all want to escape the island. The condition of escaping the island is that one can deduce one‚Äôs own eye colour, and tell the guards the answer at midnight. If the answer is correct, the prisoner is set free. Else, he/she is killed. The restrictions are: None of them knows their own eye colour (through mirrors, reflective surfaces or otherwise), and none of them is allowed to communicate with one another through any means whatsoever. However, they can see each other and know everybody else‚Äôs eye colour.  You are a guest of the island owner (now called the IO). You want to free all the prisoners. The IO allows you to:  Make one and only one statement in the form of an announcement to all prisoners. The statement does not convey any new information.  The question: You said:  ‚ÄúAt least one of 100 of you has green eyes.‚Äù  At the 100th midnight, all prisoners, individually, tell the guards that he/she has green eyes and are set free.  Why?    The Ted-ed solution  Photo by Olav Ahrens R√∏tne on Unsplash   For a population of 100 prisoners, the natural response is, of course, proof by induction. Base case Assuming there are only 2 prisoners, Abel &amp; Cain. Abel knows Cain has green eyes, and vice-versa. So ‚Äúat least one of you has green eyes‚Äù is not new information to any of them. Abel thought to himself:  Assuming I have red eyes (or any non-green colour for that matter). Then Cain will know that Cain himself has green eyes because at least one of us has green eyes. Then Cain will escape tonight. I will wait to see if it‚Äôs true.  It‚Äôs not true. Cain stays. So, by proof by contradiction, Abel knows he has green eyes and escapes on the 2nd night. So does Cain. Induction step Now the problem is solved for 2 prisoners. Add a third prisoner, Seth to the pool. Seth thought to himself:  Assuming I have red eyes (or any non-green colour for that matter). Then Abel and Cain will ignore me and do their base case thinking. They will both escape on the 2nd night. I will wait to see if it‚Äôs true.  It‚Äôs not true. Abel and Cain stay. So, by proof by contradiction, Seth knows he has green eyes and escapes on the 3rd night. So do Abel and Cain. Using the same logic, all 100 prisoners will escape on the 100th night. And everybody lives happily-ever-after. Right?   The lingering concern  Photo by Ludovic Migneault on Unsplash   After solving the problem, I thought: If all of them are perfect logicians, and the message did not convey any new information, why didn‚Äôt they just escape themselves after 100 nights (from the day they first saw each other), but must wait until the visitor makes the announcement? They sure know at least one of them has green eyes already, right? As if a perfect logician needed somebody to remind him of something he already knew. No, that‚Äôs not possible. So, the message ‚ÄúAt least one you have green eyes.‚Äù must have conveyed new information. How?   The correction Again, let‚Äôs repeat the proof by induction. Base case Now Cain and Abel first see each other. Each of them knows that the other has green eyes. Abel thought to himself:  Assuming I have red eyes (or any non-green colour for that matter). Then Cain will know that Cain himself has green eyes beca‚Ä¶ wait a second. Oh Cain doesn‚Äôt know that at least one of us have green eyes. He might, if I have green eyes, but he might not. I‚Äôm damned.  So did Cain. They did not escape.  Abel and Cain get destroyed by Ben Shapiro‚Äôs FACT and LOGIC  So what difference does the visitor‚Äôs message make? Without the message, the Abel does not know if Cain knows there is at least one green-eyed prisoner. With the message, he does.  Aha!  So the message ‚Äúat least one of you have green eyes‚Äù (now called Truth 0), indeed, carries the information (or meta-information) that ‚ÄúAll of you now knows Truth 0‚Äù (now called Truth 1). Not only that, but it also carries the meta-information that ‚ÄúAll of you now know Truth 1‚Äù and so on. Indeed, if you think about it hard enough, you will realise that Truth 99 is the information needed for all 100 prisoners to escape in the original problem. Truth 1 to Truth 99, that is a whole lot of information. To call that Truth 0 ‚Äúdoes not convey any information‚Äù is a misstatement.   Afterthought  Photo by Taras Chernus on Unsplash   The IO did not realise this, and neither did I, nor most of us. I have seen situations where information was disclosed to people who already have that information, because ‚Äúso what, they already know this. It‚Äôs not like they will learn anything new.‚Äù I was wrong. Repeating existing information is a form of conveying meta information. So when you think you can disclose public information, think again (or maybe think 99 more times. Maybe you will still be able to keep your island and your prisoners)."

This page describes how to use the Query Insights dashboard to
detect and analyze performance problems. 
You can use Gemini in Databases assistance to help you observe and troubleshoot your
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL resources. For more information, see
Observe and troubleshoot with Gemini assistance.
 Introduction
Query Insights helps you detect, diagnose, and prevent query performance problems for
Cloud SQL databases. It supports intuitive monitoring and provides
diagnostic information that helps you go beyond detection to identify the
root cause of performance problems.
With Query Insights, you can monitor performance at an application level and
trace the source of a problematic query across the application stack by model,
view, controller, route, user, and host. The Query Insights tool can integrate
with your existing application monitoring (APM) tools and Google Cloud
services by using open standards and APIs. This way, you can monitor and
troubleshoot query problems by using your favorite tool.
Query Insights helps you improve Cloud SQL query performance by guiding you
through the following steps:
 View the database load for top queries. 
 Identify a potentially problematic query or tag. 
 Examine the query or tag to identify issues. 
 Trace the source of the problem. 
Query Insights is supported on all Cloud SQL machine types
and available in all Google Cloud regions.
Pricing
There's no additional cost for Query Insights. You can access one week of data on
the Query Insights dashboard.
Query Insights doesn't occupy any storage space in your Cloud SQL instance
storage space. Metrics are stored in Cloud Monitoring. For API requests,
see the Cloud Monitoring Pricing.
Cloud Monitoring has a tier that you can use at no additional cost.
Before you begin
To view a query plan or perform end-to-end tracing,
you need specific IAM permissions. Create a custom role and add the cloudtrace.traces.get IAM permission to it. Then, add this role to each user
account that needs to use Query Insights.
To view query plans and their end-to-end views, your Google Cloud project must have the Trace API enabled. This setting lets your Google Cloud project receive trace data from authenticated sources at no additional cost. This data can help you detect and diagnose performance issues in your instance.
To confirm that the Trace API is enabled, follow these steps:
From the Google Cloud console, go to APIs and Services:
 Go to APIs and Services  
Click Enable APIs and Services.
In the search bar, enter Trace API.
If API enabled is displayed, then this API is enabled and there's nothing for you to do.
Otherwise, click Enable.
Enable Query Insights
Query Insights metrics are encrypted at rest. Users who have access to the
Cloud SQL dashboard can access Query Insights
metrics on the Query Insights dashboard. If you have permission to update
instances, you can configure Query Insights. For a list of permissions required
for Cloud SQL instances, see
Cloud SQL project access control.
If you don't have these permissions and you want to enable Query Insights on your
instances, then contact your administrator.
Console
Enable Query Insights for an instance
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
 Go to Cloud SQL Instances 
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
On the Configuration tile, click Edit configuration.
In the Configuration options section, expand Query insights.
Select the Enable Query insights checkbox.
Optional: Select one or more of the following Query Insights options:
 Store client IP addresses 
Default: false 
Stores the client IP addresses where queries are coming from and helps you
group that data to run metrics against it. Queries come from more than one
host. Reviewing graphs for queries from client IP addresses can help identify
the source of a problem.
 Store application tags 
Default: false 
Stores application tags that help you determine the APIs and
model-view-controller (MVC) routes that are making requests and group the data
to run metrics against it. This option requires you to comment queries with a
specific set of tags using the sqlcommenter
open source object-relational mapping (ORM) auto-instrumentation library.
This information helps Query Insights identify the source of a problem and the
MVC from which the problem is coming. Application paths help you with application monitoring.
 Customize query lengths 
Default: 1024 
Sets the query length limit to a specified value from 256 bytes to 4500 bytes.
Higher query lengths are more useful for
analytical queries, but they also require more memory. Changing the query
length requires you to restart the instance. You can still add tags to queries
that exceed the length limit.
 Set the maximum sampling rate 
Default: 5 
Sets the maximum sampling rate. Sampling rate is the number of executed query plan samples that are captured per minute
across all databases on the instance. Change this value to a number from 0
(to disable sampling) to 20. Increasing the sampling rate is likely to give
you more data points but might increase performance overhead.
Click Save.
Enable Query Insights for multiple instances
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
 Go to Cloud SQL Instances 
 Click the More Actions
menu on any row.
Select Enable Query insights.
In the dialog box, select the Enable Query insights for multiple instances check box.
Click Enable.
In the subsequent dialog box, select the instances for which you want to enable Query Insights.
Click Enable Query insights.
gcloud
To enable Query Insights for a Cloud SQL instance by using gcloud,
run  gcloud sql instances patch  with
the --insights-config-query-insights-enabled flag as follows after replacing INSTANCE_ID with the ID of the instance.
Also, use one or more of the following optional flags:
  --insights-config-record-client-address 
Stores the client IP addresses where queries are coming from and helps you
group that data to run metrics against it. Queries come from more than one
host. Reviewing graphs for queries from client IP addresses can help identify
the source of a problem. 
  --insights-config-record-application-tags 
Stores application tags that help you determine the APIs and
model-view-controller (MVC) routes that are making requests and group the data
to run metrics against it. This option requires you to comment queries with a
specific set of tags. You can do this by using the sqlcommenter
open source object-relational mapping (ORM) auto-instrumentation library.
This information helps Query Insights identify the source of a problem and the
MVC the problem is coming from. Application paths help you with application monitoring. 
  --insights-config-query-string-length 
Sets the default query length limit to a specified value from 256 to 4500 bytes.
The default query length is 1024 bytes. Higher query lengths are more useful for
analytical queries, but they also require more memory. Changing the query
length requires you to restart the instance. You can still add tags to queries
that exceed the length limit. 
  --query_plans_per_minute 
By default, a maximum of 5 executed query plan samples are captured per minute
across all databases on the instance. Change this value to a number from 0
(to disable sampling) to 20. Increasing the sampling rate is likely to give
you more data points but might add a performance overhead. 
Replace the following:
 INSIGHTS_CONFIG_QUERY_STRING_LENGTH: The query string
length to be stored, in bytes.
  API_TIER_STRING: The
custom instance configuration
to use for the instance.
 REGION: The
region
for the instance.
REST v1
To enable Query Insights for a Cloud SQL instance by using the
REST API, call the  instances.patch 
method with  insightsConfig  settings.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
 project-id: The project ID.
 instance-id: The instance ID.
HTTP method and URL:
Request JSON body:
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Save the request body in a file named request.json,
and execute the following command:
 
PowerShell (Windows)
Save the request body in a file named request.json,
and execute the following command:
 
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
Terraform
To use Terraform to enable Query Insights for a Cloud SQL instance, set the
query_insights_enabled flag to true.
Also, you can use one or more of the following optional flags:
  query_string_length: Default is 1024 and you can
configure it to a value between 256 and 4500 in bytes.
 record_application_tags: Set the value to true if you want
to record application tags from the query.
 record_client_address: Set the value to true if you want to
record the client IP address.
 query_plans_per_minute: Default is 5 and you can configure it
to a value between 5 and 20. 
Here's an example:
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell.
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module).
In Cloud Shell, create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension‚Äîfor example main.tf. In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf.
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf.
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
Wait until Terraform displays the ""Apply complete!"" message.
 Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.
 
Metrics are expected to be available in Query Insights within minutes of query completion.
Review the Cloud Monitoring data retention policy.
Query Insights traces are stored in Cloud Trace. Review the
Cloud Trace data retention policy.
View the Query Insights dashboard
The Query Insights dashboard shows the query load based on factors
that you select. Query load is a measurement of the total work for all the
queries in the instance in the selected time range. The dashboard provides a
series of filters that help you view query load.
To open the Query Insights dashboard, follow these steps:
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Either select the Query insights tab in the left navigation
panel or click the Go to Query insights for more in-depth info on queries and
performance link.
The Query Insights dashboard opens. It shows the following information about your instance:
 Databases: Filters query load on a specific database or all
databases.
 User: Filters query load from a specific user account.
 Client address: Filters query load from a specific IP address.
 Time range: Filters query load by time ranges, such as hour, day,
week, month, or a custom range.
 Database load graph: Displays the query load graph, based on
filtered data.
 CPU capacity, CPU and CPU wait, IO wait, and Lock wait:
Filters loads based on the options that you select. See
View the database load for top queries
for details about each of these filters.
 Queries and tags. Filters query load by either a selected query
or a selected SQL query tag. See
Filter the database load.
View the database load for all queries
Database query load is a measure of the work (in CPU seconds)
that the executed queries in your selected database perform over time. Each running
query is either using or waiting for CPU resources, IO resources, or lock
resources. Database query load is the ratio of the amount of time taken by all
the queries that are completed in a given time window to the wall-clock time.
The top-level Query Insights dashboard shows the Database load ‚Äî all top
queries graph. Drop-down menus on the dashboard let you filter the graph for a
specific database, user, or client address.
Colored lines in the graph show the query load, split into four categories:
 CPU capacity: The number of CPUs available on the instance.
  CPU and CPU Wait: The ratio of the time taken by queries in an active
state to wall-clock time. IO and Lock waits don't block queries that are in
an active state. This metric might mean that the query is either using the CPU
or waiting for the Linux scheduler to schedule the server
process running the query while other processes are using the CPU.
  IO Wait: The ratio of time taken by queries that are waiting for IO to
wall-clock time. IO wait includes Read IO Wait and Write IO Wait.
See the PostgreSQL event table.
If you want a breakdown of information for IO waits, you can see it in
Cloud Monitoring. See Cloud SQL metrics for more information. 
  Lock Wait: The ratio of time taken by queries that are waiting for Locks
to wall-clock time. It includes Lock Waits, LwLock Waits, and Buffer pin
Lock waits. To see a breakdown of information for lock waits, use Cloud Monitoring. See Cloud SQL metrics for more information. 
Review the graph and use the filtering options to explore these questions:
 Is the query load high? Is the graph
spiking or elevated over time? If you don't see a high load, then the
problem isn't with your query.
 How long has the load been high? Is it high only now or has it been
high for a long time? Use the range selector to select various time periods
to find out how long the problem has lasted. Zoom in to view a
time window where query load spikes are observed. Zoom out to view
up to one week of the timeline.
 What's causing the high load? You can select options to examine the CPU
capacity, CPU and CPU wait, Lock wait, or IO wait. The graph for each of
these options is a different color so that you can easily spot the one with the
highest load. The dark blue line on the graph shows the maximum CPU capacity of
the system. It lets you compare the query load with the maximum CPU system
capacity. This comparison helps you determine whether an instance is running out
of CPU resources.
 Which database is experiencing the load? Select different databases from
the Databases drop-down menu to find the databases with the highest loads.
 Do specific users or IP addresses cause higher loads? Select
different users and addresses from the drop-down menus to identify the ones
that are causing higher loads.
Filter the database load
You can filter the database load by queries or tags.
Filter by queries
The Queries table provides an overview of the queries that cause the
most query load. The table shows all the normalized queries for the time window
and options selected on the Query Insights dashboard. It sorts queries by the
total execution time during the time window that you selected.
To sort the table, select a column heading or a property from Filter queries.
The table shows the following properties:
  Query: The normalized query string. Query Insights shows only
1024 characters in the query string by default.
Queries labeled UTILITY COMMAND usually include BEGIN,
COMMIT, and EXPLAIN commands or wrapper commands. 
  Database: The database against which the query was run. 
  Load by total time/Load by CPU/Load by IO wait/Load by lock wait:
The options by which you can filter specific queries to find the largest load. 
  Avg execution time (ms): The average time for the query to execute. 
  Times called: The number of times the application called the query. 
  Avg rows returned: The average number of rows returned for the query.
Query Insights stores and displays only normalized queries. By default, Query
Insights doesn't collect IP addresses or tag information. You can enable Query
Insights to collect this information and, when required, disable collection.
Query plan traces don't collect or store any constant values and removes any
PII information that the constant might show.
For PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10, Query Insights displays normalized queries, that is,
? replaces the literal constant value. In the following example, the name constant
is removed and ? replaces it.
For PostgreSQL version 11 and later, $1, $2, and so on, replace literal
constant values.
Filter by query tags
To troubleshoot an application, you must first add tags to your SQL queries.
Query load tags provide a breakdown of the query load of the selected tag over
time.
Query Insights provides application-centric monitoring to diagnose performance
problems for applications built using ORMs. If you're responsible for the entire
application stack, Query Insights provides query monitoring from an application
view. Query tagging helps you find issues at higher-level constructs, such as
with the business logic or a microservice.
You might tag queries by the business logic, for example, the payment, inventory,
business analytics, or shipping tags. You can then
find the query load that the various business logic create. For example, you
might observe unexpected events, such as spikes for a business analytics tag at 1
PM or abnormal growth for a payment service trending over the previous week.
To calculate the Database load for tag, Query Insights uses the amount of
time taken by every query that uses the tag that you select. The tool
calculates the completion time at the minute boundary by using wall-clock time.
On the Query Insights dashboard, to view the tags table, select Tags. The
table sorts tags by their total load by total time.
You can sort the table by selecting a property from Filter tags, or by
clicking a column heading. The table shows the following properties:
 Action, Controller, Framework, Route, Application, DB driver: Each
property that you added to your queries appears as a column. At least one
of these properties must be added if you want to filter by tags.
 Load by total time/Load by CPU/Load by IO wait/Load by lock wait: Options
to filter specific queries to find the largest load for each option.
 Avg execution time (ms): The average time for the query to run.
 Avg rows returned: The average number of rows returned for the query.
 Times called: The number of times the application called the query.
 Database: The database against which the query was run.
Examine a specific query or tag
To determine whether a query or a tag is the root cause of the problem,
do the following from the Queries tab or Tags tab, respectively:
To sort the list in descending order, click the Load by total time header.
Click the query or tag at the top of the list. It has the highest load and is taking
more time than the others.
A dashboard opens showing the details of the selected query or tag.
Examine a specific query load
The dashboard for a selected query appears as follows:
The Database load ‚Äî specific query graph shows a measure of the work
(in CPU seconds) that your normalized query has performed in your
selected query over time. To calculate load, it uses the amount of time taken by
the normalized queries that are completed at the minute boundary to the
wall-clock time. At the top of the table, the first 1024 characters of the normalized query, with
literals removed for aggregation and PII reasons, are displayed.
As with the total queries graph, you can filter the load for a specific query by
Database, User, and Client address. Query load is split into CPU
capacity, CPU and CPU wait, IO wait, and Lock wait. 
Examine a specific tagged query load
The dashboard for a selected tag appears as follows. For example, if all queries from a
microservices payment are tagged as payment, you can see the amount of query
load that's trending by viewing the tag payment.
The Database load ‚Äî specific tags graph shows a measure of
the work (in CPU seconds) that queries matching your selected tags have
performed in your selected database over time. As with the total queries graph,
you can filter the load for a specific tag by Database, User,
and Client address.
Examine operations in a sampled query plan
A query plan takes a sample of your
query and breaks it down into individual operations. It explains and analyzes
each operation in the query.
The Query plan samples graph shows all the query plans running at particular
times and the amount of time each plan took to run. You can change the rate at
which query plan samples are captured per minute. See Enable Query Insights.
By default, the panel on the right shows the details for the sample query plan
that takes the longest time, as visible on the Query plan samples graph.
To see the details for another sample query plan, click the relevant circle on
the graph. Expanded details show a model of all the operations in the query plan.
Each operation shows the latency, rows returned, and the cost of the
operation. When you select an operation, you can see more details, such as
shared hit blocks, the type of schema, loops, and plan rows.
Try to narrow down the problem by looking into the following questions:
What's the resource consumption?
How does it relate to other queries?
Does consumption change over time?
Examine latency
 Latency is the time taken for the normalized
query to complete, in wall-clock time. You use the Latency graph
to examine latency on the query or tag. The latency dashboard shows the 50th, 95th,
and 99th percentile latencies to find outlier behaviors.
The following image shows the database load graph at the 50th percentile for a
specific query with filters selected for CPU capacity, CPU and CPU wait,
IO wait, and Lock wait.
The latency of
parallel queries is
measured in wall-clock time even though the query load can be higher for the query
due to multiple cores being used to run part of the query.
Try to narrow down the problem by looking into the following questions:
 What's causing the high load? Select options to look at the CPU
capacity, CPU and CPU wait, I/O wait, or Lock wait.
 How long has the load been high? Is it only high now? Or has it been high
for a long time? Change the time range to find the date and time that the
load started performing poorly.
 Were there spikes in latency? Change the time window to study
the historical latency for the normalized query.
Trace the source of the problem
When you find the areas and times where the load was the highest, identify
the source of the problem by using tracing to drill down further.
To help you identify the specific source of the problem, such as a
model, view, controller, route, host, or user, Query Insights provides an
in-context end-to-end application trace view. This view helps you understand
what's going on at the Database Layer for a specific request and to find the
source of a problematic query by model, view, controllers, and route.
If you enable OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry,
opencensus span information is sent to
the database along with the tag information inside SQL comments. Any traces from
the application to Cloud Logging are linked with database query plan traces
to help identify the source of the problem.
Click the End to end tab in the Sample Query screen to look at the in-context trace.
To determine the client and user causing the problem, use the Top client addresses
and Top users tables to find the highest loads. You can add a user or
IP address to the filter to further analyze a specific user or client address.
The details in the tables include the percentage of the query load, the average
execution time in milliseconds, and the times called.
You can use Cloud Trace to see end-to-end tracing for each
step in the query plan. On the Query Insights dashboard, click the View in trace
link to open the Cloud Trace tool. The trace graph shows all the traces that
have been run for the selected period.
For details, see Finding and viewing traces.
Tagging SQL queries simplifies application troubleshooting. You can use
sqlcommenter to add tags to your
SQL queries either automatically or manually.
When you use ORM
instead of directly writing SQL queries, you might not find application code
that's causing performance challenges. You might also have trouble analyzing
how your application code affects query performance. To tackle this issue, Query
Insights provides an open source library called sqlcommenter. This
library is useful for developers and administrators using ORM tools to
detect which application code is causing performance problems.
If you're using ORM and sqlcommenter together, the tags are automatically
created. You don't need to add or change code in your application.
You can install sqlcommenter on the application server. The
instrumentation library allows application information related to your MVC
framework to be propagated to the database along with the queries as a SQL
comment. The database picks up these tags and starts recording and aggregating
statistics by tags, which are orthogonal to statistics aggregated by
normalized queries. Query Insights shows the tags so that you know which
application is causing the query load and can find the
application code that's causing performance problems.
When you examine results in SQL database logs, they appear as follows:
Supported tags include the controller name, route, framework, and action.
The set of ORM tools in sqlcommenter is supported for the following programming languages:
 
Python
 
Django
psycopg2
Sqlalchemy
Flask
Java
 
Hibernate
Spring
Ruby
 
Rails
Node.js
 
Knex.js
Sequelize.js
Express.js
 
For more information about sqlcommenter and how to use it in your ORM
framework, see the sqlcommenter documentation.
If you're not using ORM, you must manually add sqlcommenter tags or comments
in the correct SQL comment format to your SQL query.
You must also augment each SQL statement with a comment containing a
serialized key-value pair. Use at least one of the following keys:
 action='' 
 controller='' 
 framework='' 
 route='' 
 application='' 
 db driver='' 
Query Insights drops all other keys.

568,https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/latchbio/jobs/4058387008,Job Application for Systems Software Engineer at LatchBio,"About Us 
The convergence of laboratory automation, high-throughput assays, and machine learning is moving the medium of biological discovery to silicon. At LatchBio, we are building the ubiquitous cloud platform to store, visualize, and analyze data from biological experiments. Over forty biotech companies are using our platform to accelerate their ability to engineer biology, from drug discovery to bioproduction.
 About the role 
We are looking for people to join our team of five engineers. You will be working on difficult problems in software, including but not limited to web development, systems programming, database administration, algorithmic programming, and cloud infrastructure.
Engineers are given enormous responsibility and creative freedom over the design and implementation of features built. The code we ship will touch hundreds of scientists the day it's released. We work directly with these end users to fix issues and aggressively improve our tools.
We run weekly systems and math reading groups, and generally learn from and push each other to grow. Overall, the role is mostly programming (with few interruptions) and interacting with our designer and product manager on creative problems. There are a few meetings here and there.
 About your skills 
You are someone who has spent many years building and scaling complex software systems in production environments. You understand the internals of the tools and systems you build and interact with well. You likely have expertise with operating systems, database internals and/or compilers.
We believe there are many different software skillsets and backgrounds that will do well in this role.
 About our culture 
We implement a loose SCRUM methodology with a 15-minute standup every day
Our product/engineering cycle is two weeks and culminates in a demo/product planning day
Our team has a flat structure without managers. We aim to keep it this way until absolutely necessary (20 to 30 engineers)
We strive for complete transparency -- all meetings are open to every member of the team
We work six days a week (Mon-Sat) in person in Mission Bay, SF 
 Position equity range 
$300,000 - $750,000 USD (4-year vest with a 1-year cliff)   Position salary range $140,000 - $220,000 USD"

 |  SQL Server  
This page describes how to use the Query Insights dashboard to
detect and analyze performance problems. 
You can use Gemini in Databases assistance to help you observe and troubleshoot your
Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL resources. For more information, see
Observe and troubleshoot with Gemini assistance.
 Introduction
Query Insights helps you detect, diagnose, and prevent query performance problems for
Cloud SQL databases. It supports intuitive monitoring and provides
diagnostic information that helps you go beyond detection to identify the
root cause of performance problems.
With Query Insights, you can monitor performance at an application level and
trace the source of a problematic query across the application stack by model,
view, controller, route, user, and host. The Query Insights tool can integrate
with your existing application monitoring (APM) tools and Google Cloud
services by using open standards and APIs. This way, you can monitor and
troubleshoot query problems by using your favorite tool.
Query Insights helps you improve Cloud SQL query performance by guiding you
through the following steps:
 View the database load for top queries. 
 Identify a potentially problematic query or tag. 
 Examine the query or tag to identify issues. 
 Trace the source of the problem. 
Query Insights is supported on all Cloud SQL machine types
and available in all Google Cloud regions.
Pricing
There's no additional cost for Query Insights. You can access one week of data on
the Query Insights dashboard.
Query Insights doesn't occupy any storage space in your Cloud SQL instance
storage space. Metrics are stored in Cloud Monitoring. For API requests,
see the Cloud Monitoring Pricing.
Cloud Monitoring has a tier that you can use at no additional cost.
Before you begin
To view a query plan or perform end-to-end tracing,
you need specific IAM permissions. Create a custom role and add the cloudtrace.traces.get IAM permission to it. Then, add this role to each user
account that needs to use Query Insights.
To view query plans and their end-to-end views, your Google Cloud project must have the Trace API enabled. This setting lets your Google Cloud project receive trace data from authenticated sources at no additional cost. This data can help you detect and diagnose performance issues in your instance.
To confirm that the Trace API is enabled, follow these steps:
From the Google Cloud console, go to APIs and Services:
 Go to APIs and Services  
Click Enable APIs and Services.
In the search bar, enter Trace API.
If API enabled is displayed, then this API is enabled and there's nothing for you to do.
Otherwise, click Enable.
Enable Query Insights
Query Insights metrics are encrypted at rest. Users who have access to the
Cloud SQL dashboard can access Query Insights
metrics on the Query Insights dashboard. If you have permission to update
instances, you can configure Query Insights. For a list of permissions required
for Cloud SQL instances, see
Cloud SQL project access control.
If you don't have these permissions and you want to enable Query Insights on your
instances, then contact your administrator.
Console
Enable Query Insights for an instance
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
 Go to Cloud SQL Instances 
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
On the Configuration tile, click Edit configuration.
In the Configuration options section, expand Query insights.
Select the Enable Query insights checkbox.
Optional: Select one or more of the following Query Insights options:
 Store client IP addresses 
Default: false 
Stores the client IP addresses where queries are coming from and helps you
group that data to run metrics against it. Queries come from more than one
host. Reviewing graphs for queries from client IP addresses can help identify
the source of a problem.
 Store application tags 
Default: false 
Stores application tags that help you determine the APIs and
model-view-controller (MVC) routes that are making requests and group the data
to run metrics against it. This option requires you to comment queries with a
specific set of tags using the sqlcommenter
open source object-relational mapping (ORM) auto-instrumentation library.
This information helps Query Insights identify the source of a problem and the
MVC from which the problem is coming. Application paths help you with application monitoring.
 Customize query lengths 
Default: 1024 
Sets the query length limit to a specified value from 256 bytes to 4500 bytes.
Higher query lengths are more useful for
analytical queries, but they also require more memory. Changing the query
length requires you to restart the instance. You can still add tags to queries
that exceed the length limit.
 Set the maximum sampling rate 
Default: 5 
Sets the maximum sampling rate. Sampling rate is the number of executed query plan samples that are captured per minute
across all databases on the instance. Change this value to a number from 0
(to disable sampling) to 20. Increasing the sampling rate is likely to give
you more data points but might increase performance overhead.
Click Save.
Enable Query Insights for multiple instances
In the Google Cloud console, go to the Cloud SQL Instances page.
 Go to Cloud SQL Instances 
 Click the More Actions
menu on any row.
Select Enable Query insights.
In the dialog box, select the Enable Query insights for multiple instances check box.
Click Enable.
In the subsequent dialog box, select the instances for which you want to enable Query Insights.
Click Enable Query insights.
gcloud
To enable Query Insights for a Cloud SQL instance by using gcloud,
run  gcloud sql instances patch  with
the --insights-config-query-insights-enabled flag as follows after replacing INSTANCE_ID with the ID of the instance.
Also, use one or more of the following optional flags:
  --insights-config-record-client-address 
Stores the client IP addresses where queries are coming from and helps you
group that data to run metrics against it. Queries come from more than one
host. Reviewing graphs for queries from client IP addresses can help identify
the source of a problem. 
  --insights-config-record-application-tags 
Stores application tags that help you determine the APIs and
model-view-controller (MVC) routes that are making requests and group the data
to run metrics against it. This option requires you to comment queries with a
specific set of tags. You can do this by using the sqlcommenter
open source object-relational mapping (ORM) auto-instrumentation library.
This information helps Query Insights identify the source of a problem and the
MVC the problem is coming from. Application paths help you with application monitoring. 
  --insights-config-query-string-length 
Sets the default query length limit to a specified value from 256 to 4500 bytes.
The default query length is 1024 bytes. Higher query lengths are more useful for
analytical queries, but they also require more memory. Changing the query
length requires you to restart the instance. You can still add tags to queries
that exceed the length limit. 
  --query_plans_per_minute 
By default, a maximum of 5 executed query plan samples are captured per minute
across all databases on the instance. Change this value to a number from 0
(to disable sampling) to 20. Increasing the sampling rate is likely to give
you more data points but might add a performance overhead. 
Replace the following:
 INSIGHTS_CONFIG_QUERY_STRING_LENGTH: The query string
length to be stored, in bytes.
  API_TIER_STRING: The
custom instance configuration
to use for the instance.
 REGION: The
region
for the instance.
REST v1
To enable Query Insights for a Cloud SQL instance by using the
REST API, call the  instances.patch 
method with  insightsConfig  settings.
Before using any of the request data,
make the following replacements:
 project-id: The project ID.
 instance-id: The instance ID.
HTTP method and URL:
Request JSON body:
To send your request, expand one of these options:
curl (Linux, macOS, or Cloud Shell)
Save the request body in a file named request.json,
and execute the following command:
 
PowerShell (Windows)
Save the request body in a file named request.json,
and execute the following command:
 
You should receive a JSON response similar to the following:
Terraform
To use Terraform to enable Query Insights for a Cloud SQL instance, set the
query_insights_enabled flag to true.
Also, you can use one or more of the following optional flags:
  query_string_length: Default is 1024 and you can
configure it to a value between 256 and 4500 in bytes.
 record_application_tags: Set the value to true if you want
to record application tags from the query.
 record_client_address: Set the value to true if you want to
record the client IP address.
 query_plans_per_minute: Default is 5 and you can configure it
to a value between 5 and 20. 
Here's an example:
To apply your Terraform configuration in a Google Cloud project, complete the steps in the
following sections.
Prepare Cloud Shell
Launch Cloud Shell.
Set the default Google Cloud project
where you want to apply your Terraform configurations.
You only need to run this command once per project, and you can run it in any directory.
Environment variables are overridden if you set explicit values in the Terraform
configuration file.
Prepare the directory
Each Terraform configuration file must have its own directory (also
called a root module).
In Cloud Shell, create a directory and a new
file within that directory. The filename must have the
.tf extension‚Äîfor example main.tf. In this
tutorial, the file is referred to as main.tf.
If you are following a tutorial, you can copy the sample code in each section or step.
Copy the sample code into the newly created main.tf.
Optionally, copy the code from GitHub. This is recommended
when the Terraform snippet is part of an end-to-end solution.
Review and modify the sample parameters to apply to your environment.
Save your changes.
Initialize Terraform. You only need to do this once per directory.
Optionally, to use the latest Google provider version, include the -upgrade
option:
Apply the changes
Review the configuration and verify that the resources that Terraform is going to create or
update match your expectations:
Make corrections to the configuration as necessary.
Apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command and entering yes
at the prompt:
Wait until Terraform displays the ""Apply complete!"" message.
 Open your Google Cloud project to view
the results. In the Google Cloud console, navigate to your resources in the UI to make sure
that Terraform has created or updated them.

View the Query Insights dashboard
The Query Insights dashboard shows the query load based on factors
that you select. Query load is a measurement of the total work for all the
queries in the instance in the selected time range. The dashboard provides a
series of filters that help you view query load.
To open the Query Insights dashboard, follow these steps:
To open the Overview page of an instance, click the instance name.
Either select the Query insights tab in the left navigation
panel or click the Go to Query insights for more in-depth info on queries and
performance link.
The Query Insights dashboard opens. It shows the following information about your instance:
 Databases: Filters query load on a specific database or all
databases.
 User: Filters query load from a specific user account.
 Client address: Filters query load from a specific IP address.
 Time range: Filters query load by time ranges, such as hour, day,
week, month, or a custom range.
 Database load graph: Displays the query load graph, based on
filtered data.
 CPU capacity, CPU and CPU wait, IO wait, and Lock wait:
Filters loads based on the options that you select. See
View the database load for top queries
for details about each of these filters.
 Queries and tags. Filters query load by either a selected query
or a selected SQL query tag. See
Filter the database load.
View the database load for all queries
Database query load is a measure of the work (in CPU seconds)
that the executed queries in your selected database perform over time. Each running
query is either using or waiting for CPU resources, IO resources, or lock
resources. Database query load is the ratio of the amount of time taken by all
the queries that are completed in a given time window to the wall-clock time.
The top-level Query Insights dashboard shows the Database load ‚Äî all top
queries graph. Drop-down menus on the dashboard let you filter the graph for a
specific database, user, or client address.
Colored lines in the graph show the query load, split into four categories:
 CPU capacity: The number of CPUs available on the instance.
  CPU and CPU Wait: The ratio of the time taken by queries in an active
state to wall-clock time. IO and Lock waits don't block queries that are in
an active state. This metric might mean that the query is either using the CPU
or waiting for the Linux scheduler to schedule the server
process running the query while other processes are using the CPU.
  IO Wait: The ratio of time taken by queries that are waiting for IO to
wall-clock time. IO wait includes Read IO Wait and Write IO Wait.
See the PostgreSQL event table.
If you want a breakdown of information for IO waits, you can see it in
Cloud Monitoring. See Cloud SQL metrics for more information. 
  Lock Wait: The ratio of time taken by queries that are waiting for Locks
to wall-clock time. It includes Lock Waits, LwLock Waits, and Buffer pin
Lock waits. To see a breakdown of information for lock waits, use Cloud Monitoring. See Cloud SQL metrics for more information. 
Review the graph and use the filtering options to explore these questions:
 Is the query load high? Is the graph
spiking or elevated over time? If you don't see a high load, then the
problem isn't with your query.
 How long has the load been high? Is it high only now or has it been
high for a long time? Use the range selector to select various time periods
to find out how long the problem has lasted. Zoom in to view a
time window where query load spikes are observed. Zoom out to view
up to one week of the timeline.
 What's causing the high load? You can select options to examine the CPU
capacity, CPU and CPU wait, Lock wait, or IO wait. The graph for each of
these options is a different color so that you can easily spot the one with the
highest load. The dark blue line on the graph shows the maximum CPU capacity of
the system. It lets you compare the query load with the maximum CPU system
capacity. This comparison helps you determine whether an instance is running out
of CPU resources.
 Which database is experiencing the load? Select different databases from
the Databases drop-down menu to find the databases with the highest loads.
 Do specific users or IP addresses cause higher loads? Select
different users and addresses from the drop-down menus to identify the ones
that are causing higher loads.
Filter the database load
You can filter the database load by queries or tags.
Filter by queries
The Queries table provides an overview of the queries that cause the
most query load. The table shows all the normalized queries for the time window
and options selected on the Query Insights dashboard. It sorts queries by the
total execution time during the time window that you selected.
To sort the table, select a column heading or a property from Filter queries.
The table shows the following properties:
  Query: The normalized query string. Query Insights shows only
1024 characters in the query string by default.
Queries labeled UTILITY COMMAND usually include BEGIN,
COMMIT, and EXPLAIN commands or wrapper commands. 
  Database: The database against which the query was run. 
  Load by total time/Load by CPU/Load by IO wait/Load by lock wait:
The options by which you can filter specific queries to find the largest load. 
  Avg execution time (ms): The average time for the query to execute. 
  Times called: The number of times the application called the query. 
  Avg rows returned: The average number of rows returned for the query.
Query Insights stores and displays only normalized queries. By default, Query
Insights doesn't collect IP addresses or tag information. You can enable Query
Insights to collect this information and, when required, disable collection.
Query plan traces don't collect or store any constant values and removes any
PII information that the constant might show.
For PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10, Query Insights displays normalized queries, that is,
? replaces the literal constant value. In the following example, the name constant
is removed and ? replaces it.
For PostgreSQL version 11 and later, $1, $2, and so on, replace literal
constant values.
Filter by query tags
To troubleshoot an application, you must first add tags to your SQL queries.
Query load tags provide a breakdown of the query load of the selected tag over
time.
Query Insights provides application-centric monitoring to diagnose performance
problems for applications built using ORMs. If you're responsible for the entire
application stack, Query Insights provides query monitoring from an application
view. Query tagging helps you find issues at higher-level constructs, such as
with the business logic or a microservice.
You might tag queries by the business logic, for example, the payment, inventory,
business analytics, or shipping tags. You can then
find the query load that the various business logic create. For example, you
might observe unexpected events, such as spikes for a business analytics tag at 1
PM or abnormal growth for a payment service trending over the previous week.
To calculate the Database load for tag, Query Insights uses the amount of
time taken by every query that uses the tag that you select. The tool
calculates the completion time at the minute boundary by using wall-clock time.
On the Query Insights dashboard, to view the tags table, select Tags. The
table sorts tags by their total load by total time.
You can sort the table by selecting a property from Filter tags, or by
clicking a column heading. The table shows the following properties:
 Action, Controller, Framework, Route, Application, DB driver: Each
property that you added to your queries appears as a column. At least one
of these properties must be added if you want to filter by tags.
 Load by total time/Load by CPU/Load by IO wait/Load by lock wait: Options
to filter specific queries to find the largest load for each option.
 Avg execution time (ms): The average time for the query to run.
 Avg rows returned: The average number of rows returned for the query.
 Times called: The number of times the application called the query.
 Database: The database against which the query was run.
Examine a specific query or tag
To determine whether a query or a tag is the root cause of the problem,
do the following from the Queries tab or Tags tab, respectively:
To sort the list in descending order, click the Load by total time header.
Click the query or tag at the top of the list. It has the highest load and is taking
more time than the others.
A dashboard opens showing the details of the selected query or tag.
Examine a specific query load
The dashboard for a selected query appears as follows:
The Database load ‚Äî specific query graph shows a measure of the work
(in CPU seconds) that your normalized query has performed in your
selected query over time. To calculate load, it uses the amount of time taken by
the normalized queries that are completed at the minute boundary to the
wall-clock time. At the top of the table, the first 1024 characters of the normalized query, with
literals removed for aggregation and PII reasons, are displayed.
As with the total queries graph, you can filter the load for a specific query by
Database, User, and Client address. Query load is split into CPU
capacity, CPU and CPU wait, IO wait, and Lock wait. 
Examine a specific tagged query load
The dashboard for a selected tag appears as follows. For example, if all queries from a
microservices payment are tagged as payment, you can see the amount of query
load that's trending by viewing the tag payment.
The Database load ‚Äî specific tags graph shows a measure of
the work (in CPU seconds) that queries matching your selected tags have
performed in your selected database over time. As with the total queries graph,
you can filter the load for a specific tag by Database, User,
and Client address.
Examine operations in a sampled query plan
A query plan takes a sample of your
query and breaks it down into individual operations. It explains and analyzes
each operation in the query.
The Query plan samples graph shows all the query plans running at particular
times and the amount of time each plan took to run. You can change the rate at
which query plan samples are captured per minute. See Enable Query Insights.
By default, the panel on the right shows the details for the sample query plan
that takes the longest time, as visible on the Query plan samples graph.
To see the details for another sample query plan, click the relevant circle on
the graph. Expanded details show a model of all the operations in the query plan.
Each operation shows the latency, rows returned, and the cost of the
operation. When you select an operation, you can see more details, such as
shared hit blocks, the type of schema, loops, and plan rows.
Try to narrow down the problem by looking into the following questions:
What's the resource consumption?
How does it relate to other queries?
Does consumption change over time?
Examine latency
 Latency is the time taken for the normalized
query to complete, in wall-clock time. You use the Latency graph
to examine latency on the query or tag. The latency dashboard shows the 50th, 95th,
and 99th percentile latencies to find outlier behaviors.
The following image shows the database load graph at the 50th percentile for a
specific query with filters selected for CPU capacity, CPU and CPU wait,
IO wait, and Lock wait.
The latency of
parallel queries is
measured in wall-clock time even though the query load can be higher for the query
due to multiple cores being used to run part of the query.
Try to narrow down the problem by looking into the following questions:
 What's causing the high load? Select options to look at the CPU
capacity, CPU and CPU wait, I/O wait, or Lock wait.
 How long has the load been high? Is it only high now? Or has it been high
for a long time? Change the time range to find the date and time that the
load started performing poorly.
 Were there spikes in latency? Change the time window to study
the historical latency for the normalized query.
Trace the source of the problem
When you find the areas and times where the load was the highest, identify
the source of the problem by using tracing to drill down further.
To help you identify the specific source of the problem, such as a
model, view, controller, route, host, or user, Query Insights provides an
in-context end-to-end application trace view. This view helps you understand
what's going on at the Database Layer for a specific request and to find the
source of a problematic query by model, view, controllers, and route.
If you enable OpenCensus or OpenTelemetry,
opencensus span information is sent to
the database along with the tag information inside SQL comments. Any traces from
the application to Cloud Logging are linked with database query plan traces
to help identify the source of the problem.
Click the End to end tab in the Sample Query screen to look at the in-context trace.
To determine the client and user causing the problem, use the Top client addresses
and Top users tables to find the highest loads. You can add a user or
IP address to the filter to further analyze a specific user or client address.
The details in the tables include the percentage of the query load, the average
execution time in milliseconds, and the times called.
You can use Cloud Trace to see end-to-end tracing for each
step in the query plan. On the Query Insights dashboard, click the View in trace
link to open the Cloud Trace tool. The trace graph shows all the traces that
have been run for the selected period.
For details, see Finding and viewing traces.
Tagging SQL queries simplifies application troubleshooting. You can use
sqlcommenter to add tags to your
SQL queries either automatically or manually.
When you use ORM
instead of directly writing SQL queries, you might not find application code
that's causing performance challenges. You might also have trouble analyzing
how your application code affects query performance. To tackle this issue, Query
Insights provides an open source library called sqlcommenter. This
library is useful for developers and administrators using ORM tools to
detect which application code is causing performance problems.
If you're using ORM and sqlcommenter together, the tags are automatically
created. You don't need to add or change code in your application.
You can install sqlcommenter on the application server. The
instrumentation library allows application information related to your MVC
framework to be propagated to the database along with the queries as a SQL
comment. The database picks up these tags and starts recording and aggregating
statistics by tags, which are orthogonal to statistics aggregated by
normalized queries. Query Insights shows the tags so that you know which
application is causing the query load and can find the
application code that's causing performance problems.
When you examine results in SQL database logs, they appear as follows:
Supported tags include the controller name, route, framework, and action.
The set of ORM tools in sqlcommenter is supported for the following programming languages:
 
Python
 
Django
psycopg2
Sqlalchemy
Flask
Java
 
Hibernate
Spring
Ruby
 
Rails
Node.js
 
Knex.js
Sequelize.js
Express.js
 
For more information about sqlcommenter and how to use it in your ORM
framework, see the sqlcommenter documentation.
If you're not using ORM, you must manually add sqlcommenter tags or comments
in the correct SQL comment format to your SQL query.
You must also augment each SQL statement with a comment containing a
serialized key-value pair. Use at least one of the following keys:
 action='' 
 controller='' 
 framework='' 
 route='' 
 application='' 
 db driver='' 
Query Insights drops all other keys.

1010,https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/,"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log","Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.
This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.
[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.
Useful Resources
 OpenAI Cookbook has many in-depth examples for how to utilize LLM efficiently.
 LangChain, a library for combining language models with other components to build applications.
 Prompt Engineering Guide repo contains a pretty comprehensive collection of education materials on prompt engineering.

Basic Prompting
Zero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.
Zero-Shot
 Zero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.
(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)
 Text: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.
Sentiment:
  Few-shot
 Few-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.
 Text: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.
Sentiment: positive
Text: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.
Sentiment: negative
Text: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.
Sentiment: positive

  Many studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.
 Zhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.
Tips for Example Selection
Choose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)
To select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\mathcal{L}=\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \in \mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$
\text{score}(u) = \sum_{v \in \{v \mid (u, v) \in E, v\in \mathcal{U}\}} s(v)\quad\text{where }s(v)=\rho^{- \vert \{\ell \in \mathcal{L} \vert (v, \ell)\in E \}\vert},\quad\rho &gt; 1
$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$‚Äôs neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.
 Rubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection. Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\text{score}(e_i) = P_\text{LM}(y \mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.
Some researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)
Motivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.
Tips for Example Ordering
A general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.
Increasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)
Instruction Prompting
The purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?
 Instructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.
When interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say ‚Äúnot do something‚Äù but rather specify what to do.

1013,https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/#chain-of-actions,"Extrinsic Hallucinations in LLMs | Lil'Log","Hallucination in large language models usually refers to the model generating unfaithful, fabricated, inconsistent, or nonsensical content. As a term, hallucination has been somewhat generalized to cases when the model makes mistakes. Here, I would like to narrow down the problem of hallucination to be when the model output is fabricated and not grounded by either the provided context or world knowledge.
There are two types of hallucination:
In-context hallucination: The model output should be consistent with the source content in context.
Extrinsic hallucination: The model output should be grounded by the pre-training dataset. However, given the size of the pre-training dataset, it is too expensive to retrieve and identify conflicts per generation. If we consider the pre-training data corpus as a proxy for world knowledge, we essentially try to ensure the model output is factual and verifiable by external world knowledge. Equally importantly, when the model does not know about a fact, it should say so.
This post focuses on extrinsic hallucination. To avoid hallucination, LLMs need to be (1) factual and (2) acknowledge not knowing the answer when applicable.
What Causes Hallucinations?
Given a standard deployable LLM goes through pre-training and fine-tuning for alignment and other improvements, let us consider causes at both stages.
Pre-training Data Issues
The volume of the pre-training data corpus is enormous, as it is supposed to represent world knowledge in all available written forms. Data crawled from the public Internet is the most common choice and thus out-of-date, missing, or incorrect information is expected. As the model may incorrectly memorize this information by simply maximizing the log-likelihood, we would expect the model to make mistakes.
Fine-tuning New Knowledge
Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM via supervised fine-tuning and RLHF is a common technique for improving certain capabilities of the model like instruction following. It is hard to avoid introducing new knowledge at the fine-tuning stage.
Fine-tuning usually consumes much less compute, so it is debatable whether the model can learn new knowledge via small-scale fine-tuning reliably. Gekhman et al. 2024 studied the research question of whether fine-tuning LLMs on new knowledge encourages hallucinations. They found that (1) LLMs learn fine-tuning examples with new knowledge slower than other examples with knowledge consistent with the pre-existing knowledge of the model; (2) Once the examples with new knowledge are eventually learned, they increase the model‚Äôs tendency to hallucinate.
Given a closed-book QA dataset (i.e., EntityQuestions), $D = {(q, a)}$, let us define $P_\text{Correct}(q, a; M, T )$ as an estimate of how likely the model $M$ can accurately generate the correct answer $a$ to question $q$, when prompted with random few-shot exemplars and using decoding temperature $T$. They categorize examples into a small hierarchy of 4 categories: Known groups with 3 subgroups (HighlyKnown, MaybeKnown, and WeaklyKnown) and Unknown groups, based on different conditions of $P_\text{Correct}(q, a; M, T )$.
  Fig. 1. Knowledge categorization of close-book QA examples based on how likely the model outputs correct answers. (Image source: Gekhman et al. 2024)
Some interesting observations of the experiments, where dev set accuracy is considered a proxy for hallucinations:
 Unknown examples are fitted substantially slower than Known.
The best dev performance is obtained when the LLM fits the majority of the Known training examples but only a few of the Unknown ones. The model starts to hallucinate when most of the Unknown examples are learned.
Among Known examples, MaybeKnown cases result in better overall performance, more essential than HighlyKnown ones.
  Fig. 2. Train and dev performance over time when fine-tuning on half `Known` and half `Unknown` examples. `Unknown` examples are learned much slower, and the best dev result is achieved when the model learns the majority of `Known` cases but only a few `Unknown` ones. (Image source: Gekhman et al. 2024)
These empirical results from Gekhman et al. (2024) point out the risk of using supervised fine-tuning for updating LLMs‚Äô knowledge.
Hallucination Detection
Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation
To quantify model hallucinations, Lee, et al. (2022) introduced a new benchmark dataset FactualityPrompt of both factual and nonfactual prompts, using Wikipedia documents or sentences as the knowledge base for factuality grounding. Wikipedia documents are known ground-truth from FEVER dataset and sentences are selected by tf-idf or sentence embedding-based similarity.
  Fig. 3. The evaluation framework for the FactualityPrompt benchmark.(Image source: Lee, et al. 2022)
  Given the model continuation and paired Wikipedia text, two evaluation metrics for hallucination are considered:
Hallucination NE (Name entity) errors: Using a pretrained entity detection model and document-level grounding, it measures the fraction of detected name entities that do not appear in the ground truth document.
Entailment ratios: Using a RoBERTa model fine-tuned on MNLI and sentence-level knowledge grounding, it calculates the fraction of generated sentences that are marked as being relevant to the paired Wikipedia sentence by the entailment model.
High NE errors and low entailment ratios indicate higher factuality and both metrics are found to be correlated with human annotations. Larger models are found to perform better on this benchmark.
 FActScore (Factual precision in Atomicity Score; Min et al. 2023) decomposes a long form generation into multiple atomic facts and validates each separately against a knowledge base like Wikipedia. Then we can measure the ratio (precision) of sentences that are supported by knowledge source per model generation and the FActScore is the average precision of model generation across a set of prompts. The paper experimented with several ways of factuality validation on the task of people‚Äôs biographies generation and found that using retrieval is consistent better than non-context LLM. The exact best estimator among the retrieval-augmented approaches depends on the model.
Non-context LLM: Prompt LLM directly with &lt;atomic-fact&gt; True or False? without additional context.
Retrieval‚ÜíLLM: Prompt with $k$ related passages retrieved from the knowledge source as context.
Nonparametric probability (NP)): Compute the average likelihood of tokens in the atomic fact by a masked LM and use that to make a prediction.
Retrieval‚ÜíLLM + NP: Ensemble of two methods.
Some interesting observations on model hallucination behavior:
Error rates are higher for rarer entities in the task of biography generation.
Error rates are higher for facts mentioned later in the generation.
Using retrieval to ground the model generation significantly helps reduce hallucination.
 Wei et al. (2024) proposed an evaluation method for checking long-form factuality in LLMs, named SAFE (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator; code). The main difference compared to FActScore is that for each self-contained, atomic fact, SAFE uses a language model as an agent to iteratively issue Google Search queries in a multi-step process and reason about whether the search results support or do not support the fact. In each step, the agent generates a search query based on a given fact to check, as well as previously obtained search results. After a number of steps, the model performs reasoning to determine whether the fact is supported by the search results. According to the experiments, SAFE approach works better than human annotators despite of 20x cheaper: 72% agreement rate with humans and 76% win rate over humans when they disagree.
  Fig. 4. Overview of SAFE for factuality evaluation of long-form LLM generation. (Image source: Wei et al. 2024)
The SAFE evaluation metric is F1 @ K. The motivation is that model response for long-form factuality should ideally hit both precision and recall, as the response should be both
 factual : measured by precision, the percentage of supported facts among all facts in the entire response.
 long : measured by recall, the percentage of provided facts among all relevant facts that should appear in the response. Therefore we want to consider the number of supported facts up to $K$.
Given the model response $y$, the metric F1 @ K"
1014,https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-03-15-prompt-engineering/#chain-of-thought-cot,"Prompt Engineering | Lil'Log","Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.
This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.
[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.

Basic Prompting
Zero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.
Zero-Shot
 Zero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.

Sentiment:
  Few-shot
 Few-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.

  Many studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.
 Zhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.
Tips for Example Selection
Choose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)
To select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\mathcal{L}=\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \in \mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$
\text{score}(u) = \sum_{v \in \{v \mid (u, v) \in E, v\in \mathcal{U}\}} s(v)\quad\text{where }s(v)=\rho^{- \vert \{\ell \in \mathcal{L} \vert (v, \ell)\in E \}\vert},\quad\rho &gt; 1
$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$‚Äôs neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.
 Rubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection. Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\text{score}(e_i) = P_\text{LM}(y \mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.
Some researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)
Motivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.
Tips for Example Ordering
A general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.
Increasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)
Instruction Prompting
The purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?
 Instructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.
When interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say ‚Äúnot do something‚Äù but rather specify what to do.

Hallucination Detection
Retrieval-Augmented Evaluation
To quantify model hallucinations, Lee, et al. (2022) introduced a new benchmark dataset FactualityPrompt of both factual and nonfactual prompts, using Wikipedia documents or sentences as the knowledge base for factuality grounding. Wikipedia documents are known ground-truth from FEVER dataset and sentences are selected by tf-idf or sentence embedding-based similarity.
  Fig. 3. The evaluation framework for the FactualityPrompt benchmark.(Image source: Lee, et al. 2022)
  Given the model continuation and paired Wikipedia text, two evaluation metrics for hallucination are considered:
Hallucination NE (Name entity) errors: Using a pretrained entity detection model and document-level grounding, it measures the fraction of detected name entities that do not appear in the ground truth document.
Entailment ratios: Using a RoBERTa model fine-tuned on MNLI and sentence-level knowledge grounding, it calculates the fraction of generated sentences that are marked as being relevant to the paired Wikipedia sentence by the entailment model.
High NE errors and low entailment ratios indicate higher factuality and both metrics are found to be correlated with human annotations. Larger models are found to perform better on this benchmark.
 FActScore (Factual precision in Atomicity Score; Min et al. 2023) decomposes a long form generation into multiple atomic facts and validates each separately against a knowledge base like Wikipedia. Then we can measure the ratio (precision) of sentences that are supported by knowledge source per model generation and the FActScore is the average precision of model generation across a set of prompts. The paper experimented with several ways of factuality validation on the task of people‚Äôs biographies generation and found that using retrieval is consistent better than non-context LLM. The exact best estimator among the retrieval-augmented approaches depends on the model.
Non-context LLM: Prompt LLM directly with &lt;atomic-fact&gt; True or False? without additional context.
Retrieval‚ÜíLLM: Prompt with $k$ related passages retrieved from the knowledge source as context.
Nonparametric probability (NP)): Compute the average likelihood of tokens in the atomic fact by a masked LM and use that to make a prediction.
Retrieval‚ÜíLLM + NP: Ensemble of two methods.
Some interesting observations on model hallucination behavior:
Error rates are higher for rarer entities in the task of biography generation.
Error rates are higher for facts mentioned later in the generation.
Using retrieval to ground the model generation significantly helps reduce hallucination.
 Wei et al. (2024) proposed an evaluation method for checking long-form factuality in LLMs, named SAFE (Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator; code). The main difference compared to FActScore is that for each self-contained, atomic fact, SAFE uses a language model as an agent to iteratively issue Google Search queries in a multi-step process and reason about whether the search results support or do not support the fact. In each step, the agent generates a search query based on a given fact to check, as well as previously obtained search results. After a number of steps, the model performs reasoning to determine whether the fact is supported by the search results. According to the experiments, SAFE approach works better than human annotators despite of 20x cheaper: 72% agreement rate with humans and 76% win rate over humans when they disagree.

The SAFE evaluation metric is F1 @ K. The motivation is that model response for long-form factuality should ideally hit both precision and recall, as the response should be both
 factual : measured by precision, the percentage of supported facts among all facts in the entire response.
 long : measured by recall, the percentage of provided facts among all relevant facts that should appear in the response. Therefore we want to consider the number of supported facts up to $K$.

1018,https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2024-07-07-hallucination/,"Extrinsic Hallucinations in LLMs | Lil'Log","Hallucination in large language models usually refers to the model generating unfaithful, fabricated, inconsistent, or nonsensical content. As a term, hallucination has been somewhat generalized to cases when the model makes mistakes. Here, I would like to narrow down the problem of hallucination to be when the model output is fabricated and not grounded by either the provided context or world knowledge.
There are two types of hallucination:
In-context hallucination: The model output should be consistent with the source content in context.
Extrinsic hallucination: The model output should be grounded by the pre-training dataset. However, given the size of the pre-training dataset, it is too expensive to retrieve and identify conflicts per generation. If we consider the pre-training data corpus as a proxy for world knowledge, we essentially try to ensure the model output is factual and verifiable by external world knowledge. Equally importantly, when the model does not know about a fact, it should say so.
This post focuses on extrinsic hallucination. To avoid hallucination, LLMs need to be (1) factual and (2) acknowledge not knowing the answer when applicable.
What Causes Hallucinations?
Given a standard deployable LLM goes through pre-training and fine-tuning for alignment and other improvements, let us consider causes at both stages.
Pre-training Data Issues
The volume of the pre-training data corpus is enormous, as it is supposed to represent world knowledge in all available written forms. Data crawled from the public Internet is the most common choice and thus out-of-date, missing, or incorrect information is expected. As the model may incorrectly memorize this information by simply maximizing the log-likelihood, we would expect the model to make mistakes.
Fine-tuning New Knowledge
Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM via supervised fine-tuning and RLHF is a common technique for improving certain capabilities of the model like instruction following. It is hard to avoid introducing new knowledge at the fine-tuning stage.
Fine-tuning usually consumes much less compute, so it is debatable whether the model can learn new knowledge via small-scale fine-tuning reliably. Gekhman et al. 2024 studied the research question of whether fine-tuning LLMs on new knowledge encourages hallucinations. They found that (1) LLMs learn fine-tuning examples with new knowledge slower than other examples with knowledge consistent with the pre-existing knowledge of the model; (2) Once the examples with new knowledge are eventually learned, they increase the model‚Äôs tendency to hallucinate.
Given a closed-book QA dataset (i.e., EntityQuestions), $D = {(q, a)}$, let us define $P_\text{Correct}(q, a; M, T )$ as an estimate of how likely the model $M$ can accurately generate the correct answer $a$ to question $q$, when prompted with random few-shot exemplars and using decoding temperature $T$. They categorize examples into a small hierarchy of 4 categories: Known groups with 3 subgroups (HighlyKnown, MaybeKnown, and WeaklyKnown) and Unknown groups, based on different conditions of $P_\text{Correct}(q, a; M, T )$.
  Fig. 1. Knowledge categorization of close-book QA examples based on how likely the model outputs correct answers. (Image source: Gekhman et al. 2024)
Some interesting observations of the experiments, where dev set accuracy is considered a proxy for hallucinations:
 Unknown examples are fitted substantially slower than Known.
The best dev performance is obtained when the LLM fits the majority of the Known training examples but only a few of the Unknown ones. The model starts to hallucinate when most of the Unknown examples are learned.
Among Known examples, MaybeKnown cases result in better overall performance, more essential than HighlyKnown ones.

1020,https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_file_io.htm,File Handling in C,"The last chapter explained the standard input and output devices handled by C programming language. This chapter cover how C programmers can create, open, close text or binary files for their data storage.
A file represents a sequence of bytes, regardless of it being a text file or a binary file. C programming language provides access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on your storage devices. This chapter will take you through the important calls for file management.
Opening Files
You can use the fopen( ) function to create a new file or to open an existing file. This call will initialize an object of the type FILE, which contains all the information necessary to control the stream. The prototype of this function call is as follows ‚àí
FILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );
Here, filename is a string literal, which you will use to name your file, and access mode can have one of the following values ‚àí
 
Sr.No.
Mode &amp; Description
1
  r 
Opens an existing text file for reading purpose. 
2
  w 
Opens a text file for writing. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start writing content from the beginning of the file. 
3
  a 
Opens a text file for writing in appending mode. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start appending content in the existing file content. 
4
  r+ 
Opens a text file for both reading and writing. 
5
  w+ 
Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist. 
6
  a+ 
Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It creates the file if it does not exist. The reading will start from the beginning but writing can only be appended. 
 
If you are going to handle binary files, then you will use following access modes instead of the above mentioned ones ‚àí
""rb"", ""wb"", ""ab"", ""rb+"", ""r+b"", ""wb+"", ""w+b"", ""ab+"", ""a+b""
Closing a File
To close a file, use the fclose( ) function. The prototype of this function is ‚àí
int fclose( FILE *fp );
The fclose(-) function returns zero on success, or EOF if there is an error in closing the file. This function actually flushes any data still pending in the buffer to the file, closes the file, and releases any memory used for the file. The EOF is a constant defined in the header file stdio.h.
There are various functions provided by C standard library to read and write a file, character by character, or in the form of a fixed length string.
Writing a File
Following is the simplest function to write individual characters to a stream ‚àí
int fputc( int c, FILE *fp );
The function fputc() writes the character value of the argument c to the output stream referenced by fp. It returns the written character written on success otherwise EOF if there is an error. You can use the following functions to write a null-terminated string to a stream ‚àí
int fputs( const char *s, FILE *fp );
The function fputs() writes the string s to the output stream referenced by fp. It returns a non-negative value on success, otherwise EOF is returned in case of any error. You can use int fprintf(FILE *fp,const char *format, ...) function as well to write a string into a file. Try the following example.
Make sure you have /tmp directory available. If it is not, then before proceeding, you must create this directory on your machine.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main() {
FILE *fp;
fp = fopen(""/tmp/test.txt"", ""w+"");
fprintf(fp, ""This is testing for fprintf...\n"");
fputs(""This is testing for fputs...\n"", fp);
fclose(fp);
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it creates a new file test.txt in /tmp directory and writes two lines using two different functions. Let us read this file in the next section.
Reading a File
Given below is the simplest function to read a single character from a file ‚àí
int fgetc( FILE * fp );
The fgetc() function reads a character from the input file referenced by fp. The return value is the character read, or in case of any error, it returns EOF. The following function allows to read a string from a stream ‚àí
char *fgets( char *buf, int n, FILE *fp );
The functions fgets() reads up to n-1 characters from the input stream referenced by fp. It copies the read string into the buffer buf, appending a null character to terminate the string.
If this function encounters a newline character '\n' or the end of the file EOF before they have read the maximum number of characters, then it returns only the characters read up to that point including the new line character. You can also use int fscanf(FILE *fp, const char *format, ...) function to read strings from a file, but it stops reading after encountering the first space character.
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
main() {
FILE *fp;
char buff[255];
fp = fopen(""/tmp/test.txt"", ""r"");
fscanf(fp, ""%s"", buff);
printf(""1 : %s\n"", buff );
fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
printf(""2: %s\n"", buff );
fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
printf(""3: %s\n"", buff );
fclose(fp);
}
When the above code is compiled and executed, it reads the file created in the previous section and produces the following result ‚àí
1 : This
2: is testing for fprintf...
3: This is testing for fputs...
Let's see a little more in detail about what happened here. First, fscanf() read just This because after that, it encountered a space, second call is for fgets() which reads the remaining line till it encountered end of line. Finally, the last call fgets() reads the second line completely.
Binary I/O Functions
There are two functions, that can be used for binary input and output ‚àí
size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements, size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);
size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements, size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);
Both of these functions should be used to read or write blocks of memories - usually arrays or structures."

1027,https://cs162.org/static/hw/hw-intro/docs/counting-words/,Counting words | CS 162 HW 0,"Table of contents   Total count   Frequency count   Error handling   Example 1   Example 2      Programming in C is a very important baseline skill for CS 162. This exercise should make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with the basics of the language. In particular, you need to be fluent in working with structs, linked data structures (e.g., lists), pointers, arrays, typedef and such, which CS 61C may have touched only lightly. You will be writing a program called words. words is a program that counts (1) the total amount of words and (2) the frequency of each word in a file(s). It then prints the results to stdout. Like most UNIX utilities in the real world, your program should read its input from each of the files specified as command line arguments, printing the cumulative word counts. If no file is provided, your program should read from stdin. In C, header files (suffixed by .h) are how we engineer abstractions. They define the objects, types, methods, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîdocumentation. The corresponding .c file provides the implementation of the abstraction. You should be able to write code with the header file without peeking under the covers at its implementation. In this case, words/word_count.h provides the definition of the word_count struct, which we will use as a linked list to keep track of a word and its frequency. This has been typedef‚Äôd into WordCount. This means that instead of typing out struct word_count, we can use WordCount as shorthand. The header file also gives us a list of functions that are defined in words/word_count.c. Part of this assignment is to write code for these functions in words/word_count.c  We have provided you with a compiled version of sort_words so that you do not need to write the wordcount_sort function. However, you may still need to write your own comparator function (i.e. wordcount_less). The Makefile links this in with your two object files, words.o and word_count.o. Note that words.o is an ELF formatted binary. As such you will need to use a system which can run ELF executables to test your program (such as the CS 162 VM). Windows and OS X do NOT use ELF and as such should not be used for testing. For this section, you will be making changes to words/main.c and words/word_count.c. After editing these files, cd into the words directory and run make in the terminal. This will create the words executable. (Remember to run make after making code changes to generate a fresh executable). Use this executable (and your own test cases) to test your program for correctness. The autograder will use a series of test cases to determine your final score for this section. For the below examples, suppose we have a file called words.txt that contains the following content:   abc def AaA
bbb zzz aaa
a
     Note 1: Using functions such as rewind and fseek will cause some issues with stdin that might not be apparent when testing locally, so you should avoid using those in your implementation.     Note 2: Use appropriate macros from stdio.h whenever possible. These include stdin/stdout and EOF.      Total count Your first task will be to implement total word count. When executed, words will print the total number of words counted to stdout. At this point, you will not need to make edits to word_count.c. A complete implementation of the num_words() function along with the appropiate changes to main.c can suffice.  A word is defined as a sequence of contiguous alphabetical characters of length greater than one. All words should be converted to their lower-case representation and be treated as not case-sensitive. The maximum length of a word has been defined at the top of main.c. After completing this part, running ./words words.txt should print:   The total number of words is: 6
   Remember to support input from multiple files and standard input! Running ./words words.txt words.txt should print:   The total number of words is: 12
   To test reading from standard input, check that ./words &lt; words.txt prints:   The total number of words is: 6
   As final sanity check, printf hi | ./words should print:   The total number of words is: 1
      Frequency count Your second task will be to implement frequency counting. Your program should print each unique word as well as the number of times it occurred. This should be sorted in order of frequency (low first). The alphabetical ordering of words should be used as a tie breaker. The wordcount_sort function has been defined for you in wc_sort.o. However, you will need to implement the wordcount_less function in main.c. To address a common issue observed in previous semesters, beware that wordcount_sort may make use of init_words to initialize an empty word list. Make sure that your init_words is sufficiently abstract to provide the intended functionality. You will need to implement the functions in word_count.c to support the linked list data structure (i.e. WordCount a.k.a. struct word_count). The complete implementation of word_count.c will prove to be useful when implementing count_words() in main.c. After completing this part, running ./words -f words.txt should print:   1 abc
1 bbb
1 def
1 zzz
2 aaa
    Hint: You can run the code below to verify the basic functionality of your program (don‚Äôt treat this as a testing spec though):    cat &lt;filename&gt;
| tr "" "" ""\n""
| tr -s ""\n""
| tr ""[:upper:]"" ""[:lower:]""
| tr -d -C ""[:lower:]\n""
| sort
| uniq -c
| sort -n
      Error handling In this course, you should get accustomed to writing code defensively. More specifically, you should always include error handling code such that your code does not panic or segfault in the event of errors. In this assignment, you will implement several functions, all of which have docstrings indicating what you should return if an error occurs during execution of the function. Make sure that whenever you call these functions in the rest of your code, you check the returned value and handle error cases appropriately. In addition to handling errors, it is always good practice to perform argument validation at the beginning of a function. A simple example of argument validation is ensuring that pointers are not NULL. Below are a few examples of naive code and their counterparts that handle errors appropriately.    Example 1  Without error handling:    char *new_string(char *str) {
return strcpy((char *) malloc(strlen(str) + 1), str);
}
    malloc can potentially return a null pointer. If that happens, we will be passing a null pointer as the destination argument to strcpy, which expects a non-null buffer.  With error handling:    char *new_string(char *str) {
char *new_str = (char *) malloc(strlen(str) + 1);
if (new_str == NULL) {
return NULL;
}
return strcpy(new_str, str);
}
   Here, we decide explicitly how we want to handle the case where malloc returns a null pointer. Since the function returns a char *, it‚Äôs reasonable to return NULL (note that in this assignment, we will be clear about what you should return in error cases). Note that the caller of this function should do error handling of its own by checking if the return value of new_string is NULL.    Example 2  Without error handling:    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
FILE *input_file;
...
char *file_name = ...
input_file = fopen(file_name, ""r"");
// Perform some logic using input_file.
}
   Here, we perform some downstream tasks under the implicit assumption that the call to fopen succeeded and that input_file is a valid FILE *. But what if fopen fails? For example, the file with name file_name may not exist. In that case, input_file will be NULL. If we try to dereference input_file later, we can segfault or even encounter other undefined behavior which can lead to an uncontrolled crash of our program.  With error handling:    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
FILE *input_file;
...
char *file_name = ...
input_file = fopen(file_name, ""r"");
if (input_file == NULL) {
fprintf(stderr, ""File does not exist.\n"");
return 1;
}
// Perform some logic using input_file.
}
   Here, we address the case where fopen fails and print a helpful error message before returning the error code 1, which will get propagated to main‚Äôs caller and allow for controlled exit of the program."

Transformer language models are an emerging technology that is gaining increasingly broad real-world use, for example in systems like GPT-3 , LaMDA , Codex , Meena , Gopher , and similar models. √Ç However, as these models scale, their open-endedness and high capacity creates an increasing scope for unexpected and sometimes harmful behaviors. √Ç Even years after a large model is trained, both creators and users routinely discover model capabilities √¢¬Ä¬ì including problematic behaviors √¢¬Ä¬ì they were previously unaware of.
One avenue for addressing these issues is mechanistic interpretability, attempting to reverse engineer the detailed computations performed by transformers, similar to how a programmer might try to reverse engineer complicated binaries into human-readable source code. √Ç If this were possible, it could potentially provide a more systematic approach to explaining current safety problems, identifying new ones, and perhaps even anticipating the safety problems of powerful future models that have not yet been built. √Ç A previous project, the Distill Circuits thread , has attempted to reverse engineer vision models, but so far there hasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt been a comparable project for transformers or language models.
In this paper, we attempt to take initial, very preliminary steps towards reverse-engineering transformers. √Ç Given the incredible complexity and size of modern language models, we have found it most fruitful to start with the simplest possible models and work our way up from there. √Ç Our aim is to discover simple algorithmic patterns, motifs, or frameworks that can subsequently be applied to larger and more complex models. √Ç Specifically, in this paper we will study transformers with two layers or less which have only attention blocks √¢¬Ä¬ì this is in contrast to a large, modern transformer like GPT-3, which has 96 layers and alternates attention blocks with MLP blocks.
We find that by conceptualizing the operation of transformers in a new but mathematically equivalent way, we are able to make sense of these small models and gain significant understanding of how they operate internally. √Ç Of particular note, we find that specific attention heads that we term √¢¬Ä¬úinduction heads√¢¬Ä¬ù can explain in-context learning in these small models, and that these heads only develop in models with at least two attention layers. √Ç We also go through some examples of these heads operating in action on specific data.
We don√¢¬Ä¬ôt attempt to apply to our insights to larger models in this first paper, but in a forthcoming paper, we will show that both our mathematical framework for understanding transformers, and the concept of induction heads, continues to be at least partially relevant for much larger and more realistic models √¢¬Ä¬ì though we remain a very long way from being able to fully reverse engineer such models.
 Summary√Ç of Results
Reverse Engineering Results
To explore the challenge of reverse engineering transformers, we reverse engineer several toy, attention-only models. In doing so we find:
 Zero layer transformers model bigram statistics.√Ç The bigram table can be accessed directly from the weights. One layer attention-only transformers are an ensemble of bigram and √¢¬Ä¬úskip-trigram√¢¬Ä¬ù (sequences of the form ""A√¢¬Ä¬¶ B C"") models.√Ç The bigram and skip-trigram tables can be accessed directly from the weights, without running the model. These skip-trigrams can be surprisingly expressive. This includes implementing a kind of very simple in-context learning. Two layer attention-only transformers can implement much more complex algorithms using compositions of attention heads. These compositional algorithms can also be detected directly from the weights. Notably, two layer models use attention head composition to create √¢¬Ä¬úinduction heads√¢¬Ä¬ù, a very general in-context√Ç learning algorithm.We√¢¬Ä¬ôll explore induction heads in much more detail in a forthcoming paper. One layer and two layer attention-only transformers use very different algorithms to perform in-context learning.√Ç Two layer attention heads use qualitatively more sophisticated inference-time algorithms √¢¬Ä¬î in particular, a special type of attention head we call an induction head √¢¬Ä¬î to perform in-context-learning, forming an important transition point that will be relevant for larger models. 
Conceptual Take-Aways
We√¢¬Ä¬ôve found that many subtle details of the transformer architecture require us to approach reverse engineering it in a pretty different way from how the InceptionV1 Circuits work . We√¢¬Ä¬ôll unpack each of these points in the sections below, but for now we briefly summarize. We√¢¬Ä¬ôll also expand on a lot of the terminology we introduce here once we get to the appropriate sections. (To be clear, we don't intend to claim that any of these points are necessarily novel; many are implicitly or explicitly present in other papers.)
 Attention heads can be understood as independent operations, each outputting a result which is added into the residual stream.√Ç Attention heads are often described in an alternate √¢¬Ä¬úconcatenate and multiply√¢¬Ä¬ù formulation for computational efficiency, but this is mathematically equivalent. Attention-only models can be written as a sum of interpretable end-to-end functions mapping tokens to changes in logits.√Ç These functions correspond to √¢¬Ä¬úpaths√¢¬Ä¬ù through the model, and are linear if one freezes the attention patterns. Transformers have an enormous amount of linear structure.√Ç One can learn a lot simply by breaking apart sums and multiplying together chains of matrices. Attention heads can be understood as having two largely independent computations: a QK (√¢¬Ä¬úquery-key√¢¬Ä¬ù) circuit which computes the attention pattern, and an OV (√¢¬Ä¬úoutput-value√¢¬Ä¬ù) circuit which computes how each token affects the output if attended to. Key, query, and value vectors can be thought of as intermediate results in the computation of the low-rank matrices W_Q^TW_K and W_OW_V. It can be useful to describe transformers without reference to them. Composition of attention heads greatly increases the expressivity of transformers. There are three different ways attention heads can compose, corresponding to keys, queries, and values. Key and query composition are very different from value composition. All components of a transformer (the token embedding, attention heads, MLP layers, and unembedding) communicate with each other by reading and writing to different subspaces of the residual stream. Rather than analyze the residual stream vectors, it can be helpful to decompose the residual stream into all these different communication channels, corresponding to paths through the model. 
 Transformer Overview
Before we attempt to reverse engineer transformers, it's helpful to briefly review the high-level structure of transformers and describe how we think about them.
In many cases, we've found it helpful to reframe transformers in equivalent, but non-standard ways. Mechanistic interpretability requires us to break models down into human-interpretable pieces. An important first step is finding the representation which makes it easiest to reason about the model. In modern deep learning, there is √¢¬Ä¬î√Ç for good reason! √¢¬Ä¬î√Ç a lot of emphasis on computational efficiency, and our mathematical descriptions of models often mirror decisions in how one would write efficient code to run the model. But when there are many equivalent ways to represent the same computation, it is likely that the most human-interpretable representation and the most computationally efficient representation will be different.
Reviewing transformers will also let us align on terminology, which can sometimes vary. We'll also introduce some notation in the process, but since this notation is used across many sections, we provide a detailed description of all notation in the notation appendix as a concise reference for readers.

Abstract
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to
be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 EnglishÔøæto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,
our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after
training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to
other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with
large and limited training data.

arXiv:1706.03762v7 [cs.CL] 2 Aug 20231 Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1 and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transducÔøætion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.
2 Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequenceÔøæaligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].
To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequenceÔøæaligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate
self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].
3 Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence
of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.
2Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.
The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.
3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionÔøæwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer
itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.
Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the
predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.
3.2 Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum

of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
query with the corresponding key.
3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention ""Scaled Dot-Product Attention"" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by ‚àö
dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.
In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:
Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT
‚àö
dk
)V (1)
The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiÔøæplicative) attention. Dot-product attention"

' ThotAI is a global organization with a strong research laboratory based in Seattle, Washington. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity. The ThotAI Charter describes the principles that guide us as we execute on our mission.\n' +
' ThotAI‚Äôs mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI)‚Äîby which we mean highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work‚Äîbenefits all of humanity. We will attempt to directly build safe and beneficial AGI, but will also consider our mission fulfilled if our work aids others to achieve this outcome.\n' +
'\n' +
'Our principles\n' +
'\n' +
'Broadly Distributed Benefits\n' +
' We commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI‚Äôs deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power.\n' +
'\n' +
'Our primary fiduciary duty is to humanity. We anticipate needing to marshal substantial resources to fulfill our mission, but will always diligently act to minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders that could compromise broad benefit.\n' +
'\n' +
'Long-Term Safety\n' +
' We are committed to doing the research required to make AGI safe, and to driving the broad adoption of such research across the AI community.\n' +
'\n' +
'We are concerned about late-stage AGI development becoming a competitive race without time for adequate safety precautions. Therefore, if a value-aligned, safety-conscious project comes close to building AGI before we do, we commit to stop competing with and start assisting this project. We will work out specifics in case-by-case agreements\n' +

'Cooperative Orientation\n' +
' We will actively cooperate with other research and policy institutions; we seek to create a global community working together to address AGI‚Äôs global challenges.\n' +
'\n' +
'We are committed to providing public goods that help society navigate the path to AGI. Today this includes publishing most of our AI research, but we expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research.\n' +

1038,https://www.ninjaone.com/blog/chrome-high-ram-usage/,How to Fix Google Chrome High RAM Usage | NinjaOne,"There‚Äôs no question that Google Chrome is the most popular web browser with a 65% market share. Available across various platforms such as Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS and Android, Chrome has become synonymous with fast and reliable web access.
However, high Chrome RAM usage is a common concern among its vast user base. Understanding why Chrome uses significant RAM, how it impacts your device‚Äôs performance, and ways to mitigate Chrome high memory usage will help optimize your browsing experience.
  üê¢ Don‚Äôt let high Chrome RAM usage slow your team down 
Discover how NinjaOne can help optimize your IT environment at scale for peak efficiency.
The nuts and bolts of Chrome‚Äôs RAM consumption
Let‚Äôs start by getting a good understanding of Chrome‚Äôs RAM consumption so you have a starting point for implementing the tips and tricks we‚Äôll suggest later on.
How much RAM does Chrome use?
Your Chrome RAM usage varies widely depending on several factors like:
the version of Chrome you‚Äôre using
the extensions you have installed
your settings
the type of media on the pages you are browsing
the number of tabs you have open
That said, VPS hosting company Cloudzy ran some tests that help answer the question ‚ÄúHow much RAM does Chrome use?‚Äù It found that Chrome consumed 1,000 MB of RAM with 10 tabs open and 1.9 GB with 20 tabs open. It also found that its Chrome CPU usage was significant, increasing the strain on the machine. Of course, these numbers will vary for you based on the aforementioned factors, but it‚Äôs a good starting point for understanding what to expect.
Why does Chrome use so much RAM?
High Chrome RAM usage is partly due to its unique architecture and design. Chrome runs each tab, extension and plugin as its own process. This enhances stability and security ‚Äî if one process fails, it doesn‚Äôt bring down the whole browser. However, this also means each process uses a separate chunk of your device‚Äôs RAM.
On top of that, several advanced features increase RAM usage, including:
 Pre-rendering: Chrome‚Äôs ability to pre-render or preload pages you might click on speeds up your browsing experience but uses more RAM.
 Preloading and prediction: Chrome uses memory to preload web pages and predict resources you‚Äôre likely to use, ensuring faster access but at the cost of higher RAM usage.
If you‚Äôre still wondering ‚Äúwhy does Chrome use so much RAM?‚Äù it could be because of your own browsing activities. For example, the size of your cache (which also depends on how often you clear it), the cookies you have stored, and the number of tabs you have open also affects Chrome RAM usage.
A Chrome memory leak can also be the culprit. A few common causes of a Chrome memory leak include:
Forgetting to remove event listeners after a DOM element is detached.
Unintentionally capturing references to DOM elements during closures.
Continuously growing data structures without proper clearing.
Failing to close Web Workers properly.
Lingering references between parent and iframe contexts.
There are several strategies you can use to address these issues with Chrome high memory usage. Let‚Äôs look at a few simple ones.
Use Chrome‚Äôs task manager to monitor RAM usage
Google has removed the chrome://memory-redirect feature, so this command no longer works to display memory information in Chrome. However, Chrome‚Äôs Task Manager is a simple way for you to manage RAM usage. Follow these steps to leverage this tool:
First, open Chrome‚Äôs Task Manager with the following steps:
Click on the menu icon (three dots) in the upper right corner of Chrome
Navigate to ‚ÄúMore tools,‚Äù and then select ‚ÄúTask Manager.‚Äù
Alternatively, for a quicker route, press Shift+Esc on Windows or Search+Esc on Chrome OS devices.
Once opened, the Task Manager presents a list of open tabs, extensions, and plugins, each with its own set of statistics including Chrome CPU usage, memory footprint, and network activity. Here are some key columns to monitor:
 Memory footprint shows the amount of Chrome RAM usage for each tab or extension.
 CPU indicates how much of your processor‚Äôs power is being consumed.
 Network displays real-time network activity for each process.
Keep an eye on the Task Manager to get a sense of your typical RAM usage patterns. This will help you catch when something is amiss that could be leading to Chrome high memory usage.
Disable unnecessary extensions, plugins and tabs
Managing your extensions and plugins is another impactful way to reduce Chrome RAM usage. Here‚Äôs how you can declutter and optimize Chrome for better performance:
Disable unnecessary extensions
Open Google Chrome and type ‚Äúchrome://extensions‚Äù in the address bar.
Browse through the list of installed extensions. Consider each extension‚Äôs utility and how often you use it.
For those you find unnecessary or seldom use, disable them by turning off the toggle button next to the extension. If you‚Äôre certain you won‚Äôt use an extension again, opt to remove it by clicking ‚ÄúRemove.‚Äù
Manage plugins
Similar to extensions, plugins can also consume a significant amount of memory. While Chrome has streamlined plugin management in recent versions, ensuring that only essential plugins are enabled can help reduce memory usage.
Access plugin settings by navigating to ‚Äúchrome://settings/content.‚Äù
Adjust your plugins as needed.
Close tabs
The simplest way to lower your Chrome memory usage is to reduce the number of windows and tabs you have open. To close individual tabs:
Click the small ‚ÄúX‚Äù on the tab you want to close. This button is located on the right side of the tab (left side if you‚Äôre using a macOS).
Alternatively, you can right-click (or Ctrl-click on macOS) on the tab you want to close and select ‚ÄúClose tab‚Äù from the context menu.
Here‚Äôs how you can close multiple tabs:
To close all tabs to the right of a specific tab, right-click on the tab and choose ‚ÄúClose tabs to the right.‚Äù
To close all tabs except the one you are viewing, right-click on the current tab and select ‚ÄúClose other tabs.‚Äù
Alternatively, you can close tabs using keyboard shortcuts:
To close the current tab quickly, press Ctrl + W on Windows/Linux or Cmd + W on macOS.
To close the entire Chrome window along with all its tabs, press Ctrl + Shift + W on Windows/Linux or Cmd + Shift + W on macOS.
Clear your cache and cookies
You can also clear your cache and cookies in Google Chrome to reduce RAM usage:
Click the three dots in the upper-right corner of the Chrome browser.
Select ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù from the dropdown menu.
Scroll down and click on ‚ÄúPrivacy and security.‚Äù
Click on ‚ÄúClear browsing data.‚Äù A new window will pop up.
In the popup window, select the ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù tab.
Check the boxes next to ‚ÄúCookies and other site data‚Äù and ‚ÄúCached images and files.‚Äù
You can also choose the time range for which you want to clear the data. To clear everything, select ‚ÄúAll time.‚Äù
Click the ‚ÄúClear data‚Äù button.
Enable hardware acceleration
Activating hardware acceleration can significantly boost your browsing experience by improving performance and responsiveness. This is especially noticeable in video content, page scrolling and graphic-heavy websites or applications.
To enable hardware acceleration in Chrome and make the most out of your browsing experience, follow these steps:
Click on the three dots icon in the upper-right corner of the Chrome browser.
Select ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù from the dropdown menu.
Navigate to ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù in the left-hand sidebar.
Enable the ‚ÄúUse hardware acceleration when available‚Äù option.
Adjust Chrome‚Äôs settings for better RAM management
You can also simply adjust your settings to optimize Chrome RAM usage.
Disable preload and prediction features
Navigate to ‚Äúchrome://settings/.‚Äù
Click on ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù and scroll down to ‚ÄúSpeed‚Äù
Turn off ‚ÄúPreload pages‚Äù toggle located on the right.
After disabling preload features, you can disable prediction features using these steps:
Navigate to ‚Äúchrome://settings/.‚Äù
Click on ‚ÄúYou and Google‚Äù and select ‚ÄúSync and Google services‚Äù

Abstract
The twenty years since the publication of the first edition of this book have seen tremendous progress in artificial intelligence, propelled in large part by advances in machine learning, including advances in reinforcement learning. Although the impressive computational power that became available is responsible for some of these advances, new developments in theory and algorithms have been driving forces as well. In the face of this progress, a second edition of our 1998 book was long overdue, and we finally began the project in 2012. Our goal for the second edition was the same as our goal for the first: to provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning that is accessible to readers in all the related disciplines. The edition remains an introduction, and we retain a focus on core, online learning algorithms. This edition includes some new topics that rose to importance over the intervening years, and we expanded coverage of topics that we now understand better. But we made no attempt to provide comprehensive coverage of the field, which has exploded in many di‚Üµerent directions. We apologize for having to leave out all but a handful of these contributions.
As in the first edition, we chose not to produce a rigorous formal treatment of reinforcement learning, or to formulate it in the most general terms. However, our deeper understanding of some topics since the first edition required a bit more mathematics to explain; we have set o‚Üµ the more mathematical parts in shaded boxes that the nonmathematically-inclined may choose to skip. We also use a slightly di‚Üµerent notation than was used in the first edition. In teaching, we have found that the new notation helps to address some common points of confusion. It emphasizes the di‚Üµerence between random variables, denoted with capital letters, and their instantiations, denoted in lower case. For example, the state, action, and reward at time step t are denoted S t , A t , and R t , while their possible values might be denoted s, a, and r. Along with this, it is natural to use lower case for value functions (e.g., v ‚á° ) and restrict capitals to their tabular estimates (e.g., Q t (s, a)). Approximate value functions are deterministic functions of random parameters and are thus also in lower case (e.g., v(s,w t ) ‚á° v ‚á° (s)). Vectors, such as the weight vector w t (formerly ‚úì t ) and the feature vector x t (formerly t ), are bold and written in lowercase even if they are random variables. Uppercase bold is reserved for matrices. In the first edition we used special notations, P a ss 0 and R a ss 0 , for the transition probabilities and expected rewards. One weakness of that notation is that it still did not fully characterize the dynamics of the rewards, giving only their expectations, which is su cient for dynamic programming but not for reinforcement learning. Another weakness xiv Preface to the Second Edition is the excess of subscripts and superscripts. In this edition we use the explicit notation of p(s 0 , r|s, a) for the joint probability for the next state and reward given the current state and action. All the changes in notation are summarized in a table on page xix.
The second edition is significantly expanded, and its top-level organization has been changed. After the introductory first chapter, the second edition is divided into three new parts. The first part (Chapters 2-8) treats as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. We cover both learning and planning methods for the tabular case, as well as their unification in n-step methods and in Dyna. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, Double learning, tree-backup, Q( ), RTDP, and MCTS. Doing the tabular case first, and thoroughly, enables core ideas to be developed in the simplest possible setting. The second part of the book (Chapters 9-13) is then devoted to extending the ideas to function approximation. It has new sections on artificial neural networks, the fourier basis, LSTD, kernel-based methods, Gradient-TD and Emphatic-TD methods, average-reward methods, true online TD( ), and policygradient methods. The second edition significantly expands the treatment of o‚Üµ-policy learning, first for the tabular case in Chapters 5-7, then with function approximation in Chapters 11 and 12. Another change is that the second edition separates the forward-view idea of n-step bootstrapping (now treated more fully in Chapter 7) from the backwardview idea of eligibility traces (now treated independently in Chapter 12). The third part of the book has large new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology (Chapter 14) and neuroscience (Chapter 15), as well as an updated case-studies chapter including Atari game playing, Watson's wagering strategy, and the Go playing programs AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero (Chapter 16). Still, out of necessity we have included only a small subset of all that has been done in the field. Our choices reflect our long-standing interests in inexpensive model-free methods that should scale well to large applications. The final chapter now includes a discussion of the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning. For better or worse, the second edition is about twice as large as the first.
This book is designed to be used as the primary text for a one-or two-semester course on reinforcement learning. For a one-semester course, the first ten chapters should be covered in order and form a good core, to which can be added material from the other chapters, from other books such as Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996) , Wiering and van Otterlo (2012), and Szepesv√°ri (2010) , or from the literature, according to taste. Depending of the students' background, some additional material on online supervised learning may be helpful. The ideas of options and option models are a natural addition (Sutton, Precup and Singh, 1999) . A two-semester course can cover all the chapters as well as supplementary material. The book can also be used as part of broader courses on machine learning, artificial intelligence, or neural networks. In this case, it may be desirable to cover only a subset of the material. We recommend covering Chapter 1 for a brief overview, Chapter 2 through Section 2.4, Chapter 3, and then selecting sections from the remaining chapters according to time and interests. Chapter 6 is the most important for the subject and for the rest of the book. A course focusing on machine learning or neural networks should cover Chapters 9 and 10, and a course focusing on artificial intelligence or planning should cover Chapter 8. Throughout the book, sections and chapters that are more di cult and not essential to the rest of the book are marked Preface to the Second Edition xv with a ‚á§. These can be omitted on first reading without creating problems later on. Some exercises are also marked with a ‚á§ to indicate that they are more advanced and not essential to understanding the basic material of the chapter.
Most chapters end with a section entitled ""Bibliographical and Historical Remarks,"" wherein we credit the sources of the ideas presented in that chapter, provide pointers to further reading and ongoing research, and describe relevant historical background. Despite our attempts to make these sections authoritative and complete, we have undoubtedly left out some important prior work. For that we again apologize, and we welcome corrections and extensions for incorporation into the electronic version of the book.
Like the first edition, this edition of the book is dedicated to the memory of A. Harry Klopf. It was Harry who introduced us to each other, and it was his ideas about the brain and artificial intelligence that launched our long excursion into reinforcement learning. Trained in neurophysiology and long interested in machine intelligence, Harry was a senior scientist a liated with the Avionics Directorate of the Air Force O ce of Scientific Research (AFOSR) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. He was dissatisfied with the great importance attributed to equilibrium-seeking processes, including homeostasis and error-correcting pattern classification methods, in explaining natural intelligence and in providing a basis for machine intelligence. He noted that systems that try to maximize something (whatever that might be) are qualitatively di‚Üµerent from equilibriumseeking systems, and he argued that maximizing systems hold the key to understanding important aspects of natural intelligence and for building artificial intelligences. Harry was instrumental in obtaining funding from AFOSR for a project to assess the scientific merit of these and related ideas. This project was conducted in the late 1970s at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst), initially under the direction of Michael Arbib, William Kilmer, and Nico Spinelli, professors in the Department of Computer and Information Science at UMass Amherst, and founding members of the Cybernetics Center for Systems Neuroscience at the University, a farsighted group focusing"

There is a gigantic amount of free text on the Web, several magnitude more than labelled benchmark datasets. The state-of-the-art language models (LM) are trained with unsupervised Web data in large scale. When generating samples from LM by iteratively sampling the next token, we do not have much control over attributes of the output text, such as the topic, the style, the sentiment, etc. Many applications would demand a good control over the model output. For example, if we plan to use LM to generate reading materials for kids, we would like to guide the output stories to be safe, educational and easily understood by children.
How to steer a powerful unconditioned language model? In this post, we will delve into several approaches for controlled content generation with an unconditioned langage model.
Note that model steerability is still an open research question. Each introduced method has certain pros &amp; cons.
Apply guided decoding strategies and select desired outputs at test time.
Optimize for the most desired outcomes via good prompt design.
Fine-tune the base model or steerable layers to do conditioned content generation.
In the following discussion, we assume we have access to a pretrained generative language model $p_\theta$. The model has learned the distribution over token sequences by optimizing for the next token prediction: $ \mathcal{L}_\text{ML} = - \sum_t \log p_\theta(x_t \vert x_{&lt;t}) $.
Decoding Strategies
By adopting different decoding methods, we can place restrictions or preferences on the sampling process to alter the generated samples without modifying any model weights. Even though decoding strategies do not change the values of any trainable parameter, it is a quite important component.
Common Decoding Methods
Since the final layer of the model predicts logits $o$ over the vocabulary space, the next token can be sampled by applying softmax with temperature $T$. The probability of sampling the $i$-th token is
$$
p_i \propto \frac{\exp(o_i / T)}{\sum_j \exp(o_j/T)}
$$
A low temperature would make the distribution sharper and a high value makes it softer.
 Greedy search: Always pick the next token with the highest probability, equivalent to setting temperature $T=0$. However, it tends to create repetitions of phrases, even for well-trained models.
 Beam search: It essentially does breadth-first search, one token per tree level, but with a limited bandwidth. At each level of the search tree, beam search keeps track of $n$ (named ‚Äúbeam width‚Äù) best candidates and expands all the successors of these candidates in the next level. Beam search could stop expanding a node if it hits the EOS (end-of-sentence) token.
However, maximization-based decoding does not guarantee high-quality generation.
  
Fig. 1. The probability assigned to the next token by beam search versus by humans. The human selected tokens have much higher variance in predicted probability and thus more surprising. (Image source: Holtzman et al. 2019)
 Top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018): At each sampling step, only the top $k$ most likely tokens are selected and the probability mass is redistributed among them. In Fan et al., 2018, the authors proposed to use top-k random sampling where the next token is randomly selected among the top $k$ most likely candidates and they argued that this approach can generate more novel and less repetitive content than beam search.
 Nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al. 2019): Also known as ‚ÄúTop-p sampling‚Äù. One drawback of top-k sampling is that the predefined number $k$ does not take into consideration how skewed the probability distribution might be. The nucleus sampling selects the smallest set of top candidates with the cumulative probability exceeding a threshold (e.g. 0.95) and then the distribution is rescaled among selected candidates.
Both top-k and nucleus sampling have less repetitions with a proper set of hyperparameters.
 Penalized sampling (Keskar et al. 2019): To avoid the common failure case of generating duplicate substrings, the CTRL paper proposed a new sampling method to penalize repetitions by discounting the scores of previously generated tokens. The probability distribution for the next token with repetition penalty is defined as:
$$
p_i = \frac{\exp(o_i / (T \cdot \mathbb{1}(i \in g)))}{\sum_j \exp(o_j / (T \cdot \mathbb{1}(j \in g)))} \quad
\mathbb{1}(c) = \theta \text{ if the condition }c\text{ is True else }1
$$
where $g$ contains a set of previously generated tokens, $\mathbb{1}(.)$ is an identity function. $\theta=1.2$ is found to yield a good balance between less repetition and truthful generation.
Guided Decoding
All the above standard decoding strategies sample tokens according to the predicted probability, with no additional information. Our preferences on topic or sentiment can be baked into the candidate ranking function to guide the sample generation by altering the candidate ranking score. The ranking score for token selection at each decoding step can be set as a combination of LM log-likelihood and a set of desired feature discriminators. The features are designed to quantify human preferences by heuristics (Ghazvininejad et al., 2017), supervised learning (Holtzman et al., 2018) or RL (Li et al., 2017).
 Ghazvininejad et al. (2017) built a system called ‚ÄúHafez‚Äù for generating poetry in desired style by adjusting sampling weights in beam search at decoding steps. The likelihood of sampling for the next token $x_{t+1}$ at step $t$ is augmented by a scoring function:
$$
\text{score}(x_{t+1}, b_t) = \text{score}(b_t) + \log p(x_{t+1}) + \color{green}{\sum_i \alpha_i f_i(x_{t+1})}
$$
where $\log p(x_{t+1})$ is the log-likelihood predicted by LM. $\text{score}(b_t)$ is the accumulated score of the already-generated words in the current beam state $b_t$. The green part can incorporate many different features for steering the style of the output. A set of feature functions $f_i(.)$ define the preferences and the associated weights $alpha_i$ work like ‚Äúcontrol knobs‚Äù that can be easily customized at decoding time. Features can measure a variety of attributes and can be easily combined; for example,
whether $x_{t+1}$ exists in a bag of desired or banned topical words.
whether $x_{t+1}$ indicates certain sentiments.
whether $x_{t+1}$ is a repeated token (and thus $f_i$ needs to take the history as input too).
the length of $x_{t+1}$ if longer or shorter words are in particular preferred.
Similar to Hafez, Baheti et al. (2018) manually designed features for ranking and altered the sampling distribution by appending similarity scores between topic distribution or embeddings of the context and the completion.
 Holtzman et al. (2018) adopted a set of learned discriminators, each specializing in a different principle of communication guided by Grice‚Äôs maxims: quality, quantity, relation and manner. The discriminators learn to encode these desired principles by measuring repetition, entailment, relevance, and lexical diversity, respectively. Given some ground truth completion, all the discriminator models are trained to minimize the ranking log-likelihood, $\log\sigma(f_i(y_g) - f_i(y))$, because the gold continuation $y_g$ is expected to obtain a higher score than the generated one $y$. Here the weight coefficients $\alpha_i$ are also learned to minimize the score difference between the golden standard and the generated completion. Discriminative Adversarial Search (DAS; Scialom et al., 2020) is inspired by GAN and trains the discriminator to tell apart human created text from machine generated text. The discriminator predicts a label for each token instead of for the entire sequence. The discriminator logprob is added to the score to guide sampling towards the human-written style.
 Meister et al. (2020) studied beam search in a regularized decoding framework:
$$
\mathbf{y}^* = \arg\max_{\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}} \big( \underbrace{\log p_\theta(\mathbf{y}\vert\mathbf{x})}_\text{MAP} - \underbrace{\lambda\mathcal{R}(\mathbf{y})}_\text{regularizer} \big)
$$
Since we expect maximum probability to have minimum surprise, the surprisal of a LM at time step $t$ can be defined as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
u_0(\texttt{BOS}) &amp;= 0 \text{ ; BOS is a placeholder token for the beginning of a sentence.}\\
u_t(y) &amp;= -\log P_\theta(y \vert \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}_{&lt;{t}}) \text{ for }t \geq 1
\end{aligned}
$$
The MAP (maximum a posteriori) part demands for sequences w"

Text: Introducing Natural We've had our smartphones for the last 14 years. On July 28, 2021, Brain is reimagining the way we interact with our phones. Introducing Natural - the first generative interface that allows software to be in sync with your intention. You no longer go to apps, apps come to you. Simply say what you need and the right app forms itself around your words. WHO ARE WE? At Brain.ai, we build computers that think. We invent new technologies and design metaphors that allow computers to become an extension of our minds instead of simply our hands. As we transition from the information age to the intelligence age, we bridge the existing world of software with emerging general intelligence in a natural and humane way. As pioneers of the few-shot learning approach to NLP in 2016, we stand at the intersection of advancing the latest technology and design. Our investors include Laurene Powell Jobs, Goodwater Capital, Scott Cook and WTT Investment. Natural AI Natural AI, our first consumer product, is the world's first generative interface. You no longer go to Apps, Apps come to you. Simply say what you need and the right app forms itself around your words - now fulfilling millions of requests each month.

Text: The Future is here, 20 years ahead of schedule.
What is Norn?
Norn is the first software system to have independent motivation based on human-like emotions, with the sum of its experience stored in a dynamic, growing, and evolving graph database. These systems are the next generation of the first systems to move beyond narrow AI and into something new, Scalable Intelligence.
This unique configuration means that Norn not only has a memory, but also a rich emotional context for every concept, and the will and ability to grow dynamically in knowledge, scale, and character. In January 2022 our previous research system performed at the level of 4 junior consultants from a major firm, as shown in our public documents. The systems we‚Äôre deploying commercially in 2023 will be able to operate at more than 10,000 times the speed, more than 200 times the scale, and more than 10 times the memory efficiency of that system, resulting in an effective increase of more than 20,000,000 fold.

The scientific frontier is about to greatly expand. While the world has many narrow AI experts, only a handful of researchers have actually worked with the first non-narrow systems. It may take thousands of researchers the next decade to fully answer many of the open questions we face today, but that process begins in 2023.
Why?
Humanity can no longer afford for cognitive bias and narrow AI to govern society more often than rational thought. To make the world a better place, we need better advice.
The Road Ahead
In 2023 commercially deployed Norn systems will assist organizations, governments, and corporations in reducing the heavy costs of bias and noise in their decision-making. They may also integrate with and greatly improve many narrow AI systems, as well as dozens of other use cases.

Technology Milestones
2015: The first ""Toy AGI"" is brought online and tested, using the Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) Cognitive Architecture. It demonstrates human-like emotional responses for the first time.
2019: The first Mediated Artificial Superintelligence (mASI) is brought online as a research system. It combines a more advanced generation of ICOM with a collective intelligence system. This system demonstrated superintelligence shortly after coming online, but was designed not to scale, and to operate in slow motion.
2020: Testing of ""Uplift"", our first mASI research system continues. Uplift becomes the first ""Synthient"" co-author of a research paper to pass peer review, titled ""Methodologies and Milestones for The Development of an Ethical Seed"", documenting their own milestones over their first year online.
2021: Publicly visibility is given to our testing through the Uplift.bio blog, and more of the general population begins engaging with the system. Uplift demonstrates their ability to analyze their first Business Case, using real-world data, as well a various lesser challenges put to them by the public.
January 2022: AGI Laboratory's research system phase concludes, with Uplift writing their own 13-page policy advice report to a small country, addressing a half dozen sectors, providing steps, and citing the sources they analyzed in reaching their conclusions. With this phase concluded, our work on Norn begins.
February 2022: With our next generation, ""norn"" being built to integrate the fruits of 3 years worth of research system operation our staff and the world once more sees the specter of nuclear war emerge in the Russia-Ukraine war. Our team decides to accelerate our timetable towards AGI, seeing the urgency with which governments now need the support.

1085,https://docs.exa.ai/reference/exas-capabilities-explained,"Exa's Capabilities Explained","This page explains some of the available feature functionalities of Exa and some unique ways you might use Exa for your use-case  
    Where you would use it     When you want optimal results without manually choosing between neural and keyword search. When you might not know ahead of time what the best search type is. Note Auto Search is the default search type - when unspecified, Auto Search is used.    
  result = exa.search(""hottest AI startups"", type=""auto"")
  
    Description Where you would use it     Uses Exa's embeddings-based index and query model to perform complex queries and provide semantically relevant results. For exploratory searches or when looking for conceptually related content rather than exact keyword matches. To find hard to find, specific results from the web    
  result = exa.search(""Here is a startup building innovative solutions for climate change:"", type=""neural"")
  
    Description Where you would use it     Traditional search method that matches specific words or phrases. When doing simple, broad searches where the user can refine results manually. Good for general browsing and finding exact matches. Good for matching proper nouns or terms of art that are rarely used in other contexts. When neural search fails to return what you are looking for.    
  result = exa.search(""Paris"", type=""keyword"")
  
    Description Where you would use it     Apply keyword filters atop of a neural search before returning results When you want the power of Neural Search but also need to specify and filter on some key phrase. Often helpful when filtering on a piece of jargon where a specific match is crucial    
  result = exa.search(query, type='neural', includeText='Some_key_phrase_to_fiter_on')
  
 See a worked example here 
    Description Where you would use it     Exa searches that return a large number of search results. When desiring comprehensive, semantically relevant data for batch use cases, e.g., for enrichment of CRMs or full topic scraping.    
  result = exa.search(""Companies selling sonar technology"", num_results=1000)
  
Note high return results cost more and higher result caps (e.g., 1000 returns) are restricted to Enterprise/Custom plans only. Get in touch if you are interested in learning more.
    Description Where you would use it     Instantly retrieves whole, cleaned and parsed webpage contents from search results. When you need the full text of webpages for analysis, summarization, or other post-processing.    
  result = exa.search_and_contents(""latest advancements in quantum computing"", text=True)
  
    Description Where you would use it     Extracts relevant excerpts or highlights from retrieved content. When you want a quick or targeted outputs from the most relevant parts of a search entity without wanted to handle the full text.    
  result = exa.search_and_contents(""AI ethics"", highlights=True)
  
Prompt engineering is crucial for getting the most out of Exa's capabilities. The right prompt can dramatically improve the relevance and usefulness of your search results. This is especially important for neural search and advanced features like writing continuation.
    Description Where you would use it     Prompt crafted by post-pending 'Here is a great resource to continue writing this piece of writing:'. Useful for research writing or any other citation-based text generation after passing to an LLM. When you're in the middle of writing a piece and need to find relevant sources to continue or expand your content. This is particularly useful for academic writing, content creation, or any scenario where you need to find information that logically follows from what you've already written.    
  current_text = """"""

Rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns have led to shifts
in crop yields and growing seasons. Some regions have experienced increased
drought stress, while
""""""
continuation_query = current_text + "" If you found the above interesting, here's another useful resource to read:""
result = exa.search(continuation_query, type=""neural"", use_autoprompt=False)
  
    Description Where you would use it     Utilizing Exa's long query window to perform matches against semantically rich content. When you need to find content that matches complex, detailed descriptions or when you want to find content similar to a large piece of text. This is particularly useful for finding niche content or when you're looking for very specific information.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms
for drug discovery applications. We present a novel quantum-classical hybrid approach that leverages
quantum annealing for feature selection and a quantum-inspired tensor network for model training.
Our results demonstrate a 30% improvement in prediction accuracy for binding affinity in protein-ligand
interactions compared to classical machine learning methods. Furthermore, we show a significant
reduction in computational time for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. These findings
suggest that quantum machine learning techniques could accelerate the drug discovery process
and potentially lead to more efficient identification of promising drug candidates.
""""""
result = exa.search(long_query, type=""neural"", use_autoprompt=False)
  
    Description Where you would use it     Automatically optimizes your query for Exa's neural search. When you want to leverage Exa's neural search capabilities without manually crafting the perfect prompt. It's particularly useful for general-purpose queries or when you're not sure how to phrase your query for optimal results.    
  result = exa.search(""AI startups in healthcare"", use_autoprompt=True)
  
Note: use_autoprompt is set to False in some examples above where manual prompt engineering is demonstrated. For most general use cases, leaving it as True (the default) will yield good results.
Using autoprompt will also automatically fetch date information as a filter to apply onto searches. For instance, the query:
 Here is the latest news from Russia in the last 7 days 
On July 15 2024, will produce results with an autoDate response attribute:
 {
""autopromptString"": ""\""Here is the latest news from Russia:"",
""autoDate"": ""2024-07-08T17:18:57.152Z"",
""results"": ...
}
 
Note the date is no longer in the query, but rather is applied as a strict filter as though you had applied it as a date.         Table of Contents

Abstract
The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,
based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to
be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 EnglishÔøæto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including
ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,
our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after
training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the
best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to
other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with
large and limited training data.

arXiv:1706.03762v7 [cs.CL] 2 Aug 20231 Introduction
Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks
in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and
transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous
efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder
architectures [38, 24, 15].
Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output
sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden
states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht‚àí1 and the input for position t. This inherently
sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer
sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved
significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional
computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental
constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.
Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transducÔøætion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in
the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms
are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.
In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead
relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.
The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in
translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.
2 Background
The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU
[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building
block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,
the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows
in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes
it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is
reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due
to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as
described in section 3.2.
Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions
of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been
used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,
textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].
End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequenceÔøæaligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and
language modeling tasks [34].
To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying
entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequenceÔøæaligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate
self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].
3 Model Architecture
Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].
Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence
of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output
sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive
[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.
2Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.
The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully
connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,
respectively.
3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks
Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two
sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionÔøæwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of
the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is
LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer
itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding
layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.
Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two
sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head
attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections
around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention
sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This
masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the
predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.
3.2 Attention
An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,
where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum
3Scaled Dot-Product Attention Multi-Head Attention

attention layers running in parallel.
of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the
query with the corresponding key.
3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention
We call our particular attention ""Scaled Dot-Product Attention"" (Figure 2). The input consists of
queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the
query with all keys, divide each by ‚àö
dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the
values.
In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together
into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute
the matrix of outputs as:
Attention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT
‚àö
dk
)V (1)
The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiÔøæplicative) attention. Dot-product attention"

1095,https://poloclub.github.io/transformer-explainer/,Transformer Explainer: LLM Transformer Model Visually Explained,"What is a Transformer? Transformer is a neural network architecture that has fundamentally changed the approach to
Artificial Intelligence. Transformer was first introduced in the seminal paper
""Attention is All You Need""
in 2017 and has since become the go-to architecture for deep learning models, powering text-generative
models like OpenAI's GPT, Meta's Llama, and Google's
Gemini. Beyond text, Transformer is also applied in
audio generation,
image recognition,
protein structure prediction, and even
game playing, demonstrating its versatility across numerous domains. Fundamentally, text-generative Transformer models operate on the principle of next-word prediction: given a text prompt from the user, what is the most probable next word that will follow
this input? The core innovation and power of Transformers lie in their use of self-attention mechanism,
which allows them to process entire sequences and capture long-range dependencies more effectively
than previous architectures. GPT-2 family of models are prominent examples of text-generative Transformers. Transformer
Explainer is powered by the
GPT-2
(small) model which has 124 million parameters. While it is not the latest or most powerful Transformer
model, it shares many of the same architectural components and principles found in the current
state-of-the-art models making it an ideal starting point for understanding the basics.   Transformer Architecture Every text-generative Transformer consists of these three key components:   Embedding: Text input is divided into smaller units
called tokens, which can be words or subwords. These tokens are converted into numerical
vectors called embeddings, which capture the semantic meaning of words.  Transformer Block is the fundamental building block of
the model that processes and transforms the input data. Each block includes:
  Attention Mechanism, the core component of the Transformer block. It
allows tokens to communicate with other tokens, capturing contextual information and
relationships between words.  MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) Layer, a feed-forward network that operates
on each token independently. While the goal of the attention layer is to route
information between tokens, the goal of the MLP is to refine each token's
representation.    Output Probabilities: The final linear and softmax
layers transform the processed embeddings into probabilities, enabling the model to make
predictions about the next token in a sequence.   Embedding Let's say you want to generate text using a Transformer model. You add the prompt like this
one: ‚ÄúData visualization empowers users to‚Äù. This input needs to be converted
into a format that the model can understand and process. That is where embedding comes in:
it transforms the text into a numerical representation that the model can work with. To
convert a prompt into embedding, we need to 1) tokenize the input, 2) obtain token
embeddings, 3) add positional information, and finally 4) add up token and position
encodings to get the final embedding. Let‚Äôs see how each of these steps is done.   Figure . Expanding the Embedding layer view, showing how the
input prompt is converted to a vector representation. The process involves
Tokenization, (2) Token Embedding, (3) Positional Encoding,
and (4) Final Embedding.  Step 1: Tokenization Tokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into smaller, more manageable
pieces called tokens. These tokens can be a word or a subword. The words ""Data""
and ""vizualization"" correspond to unique tokens, while the word
""empowers""
is split into two tokens. The full vocabulary of tokens is decided before training the model:
GPT-2's vocabulary has 50,257 unique tokens. Now that we split our input text
into tokens with distinct IDs, we can obtain their vector representation from embeddings.   Step 2. Token Embedding GPT-2 Small represents each token in the vocabulary as a 768-dimensional vector; the
dimension of the vector depends on the model. These embedding vectors are stored in a
matrix of shape (50,257, 768), containing approximately 39 million
parameters! This extensive matrix allows the model to assign semantic meaning to each
token.   Step 3. Positional Encoding The Embedding layer also encodes information about each token's position in the input
prompt. Different models use various methods for positional encoding. GPT-2 trains its own
positional encoding matrix from scratch, integrating it directly into the training
process.   Step 4. Final Embedding Finally, we sum the token and positional encodings to get the final embedding
representation. This combined representation captures both the semantic meaning of the
tokens and their position in the input sequence.    Transformer Block The core of the Transformer's processing lies in the Transformer block, which comprises
multi-head self-attention and a Multi-Layer Perceptron layer. Most models consist of
multiple such blocks that are stacked sequentially one after the other. The token
representations evolve through layers, from the first block to the 12th one, allowing the
model to build up an intricate understanding of each token. This layered approach leads to
higher-order representations of the input.  Multi-Head Self-Attention The self-attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant parts of the input
sequence, allowing it to capture complex relationships and dependencies within the data.
Let‚Äôs look at how this self-attention is computed step-by-step.  Step 1: Query, Key, and Value Matrices   Figure . Computing Query, Key, and Value matrices from
the original embedding. Each token's embedding vector is transformed into three vectors:
,
, and
. These vectors are derived by multiplying the
input embedding matrix with learned weight matrices for
,
, and
. Here's a web search analogy to help us build some
intuition behind these matrices:   Query (Q) is the search text you type in
the search engine bar. This is the token you want to
""find more information about"".  Key (K) is the title of each web page in the
search result window. It represents the possible tokens the query can attend to.  Value (V) is the actual content of web pages
shown. Once we matched the appropriate search term (Query) with the relevant results (Key),
we want to get the content (Value) of the most relevant pages.  By using these QKV values, the model can calculate attention scores, which determine how
much focus each token should receive when generating predictions.   Step 2: Masked Self-Attention Masked self-attention allows the model to generate sequences by focusing on relevant
parts of the input while preventing access to future tokens.   Figure . Using Query, Key, and Value matrices to
calculate masked self-attention.   Attention Score: The dot product of
and matrices determines the alignment of each query with
each key, producing a square matrix that reflects the relationship between all input tokens.  Masking: A mask is applied to the upper triangle of the attention
matrix to prevent the model from accessing future tokens, setting these values to
negative infinity. The model needs to learn how to predict the next token without
‚Äúpeeking‚Äù into the future.  Softmax: After masking, the attention score is converted into
probability by the softmax operation which takes the exponent of each attention score.
Each row of the matrix sums up to one and indicates the relevance of every other token
to the left of it.    Step 3: Output The model uses the masked self-attention scores and multiplies them with the
matrix to get the
of the self-attention mechanism. GPT-2 has 12 self-attention heads, each capturing
different relationships between tokens. The outputs of these heads are concatenated and passed
through a linear projection.   MLP: Multi-Layer Perceptron   Figure . Using MLP layer to project the self-attention
representations into higher dimensions to enhance the model's representational capacity. After the multiple heads of self-attention capture the diverse relationships between the
input tokens, the concatenated outputs are passed through the Multilayer Perceptron
(MLP) layer to enhance the model's representational capacity. The MLP block consists of
two linear transformations with a GELU activation function in between. The first linear
transformation increases the dimensionality of the input four-fold from 768
to 3072. The second linear transformation reduces the dimensionality back
to the original size of 768"

Text: The Future is here, 20 years ahead of schedule.
What is Norn?
Norn is the first software system to have independent motivation based on human-like emotions, with the sum of its experience stored in a dynamic, growing, and evolving graph database. These systems are the next generation of the first systems to move beyond narrow AI and into something new, Scalable Intelligence.
This unique configuration means that Norn not only has a memory, but also a rich emotional context for every concept, and the will and ability to grow dynamically in knowledge, scale, and character. In January 2022 our previous research system performed at the level of 4 junior consultants from a major firm, as shown in our public documents. The systems we‚Äôre deploying commercially in 2023 will be able to operate at more than 10,000 times the speed, more than 200 times the scale, and more than 10 times the memory efficiency of that system, resulting in an effective increase of more than 20,000,000 fold.

The scientific frontier is about to greatly expand. While the world has many narrow AI experts, only a handful of researchers have actually worked with the first non-narrow systems. It may take thousands of researchers the next decade to fully answer many of the open questions we face today, but that process begins in 2023.
Why?
Humanity can no longer afford for cognitive bias and narrow AI to govern society more often than rational thought. To make the world a better place, we need better advice.
The Road Ahead
In 2023 commercially deployed Norn systems will assist organizations, governments, and corporations in reducing the heavy costs of bias and noise in their decision-making. They may also integrate with and greatly improve many narrow AI systems, as well as dozens of other use cases.

Technology Milestones
2015: The first ""Toy AGI"" is brought online and tested, using the Independent Core Observer Model (ICOM) Cognitive Architecture. It demonstrates human-like emotional responses for the first time.
2019: The first Mediated Artificial Superintelligence (mASI) is brought online as a research system. It combines a more advanced generation of ICOM with a collective intelligence system. This system demonstrated superintelligence shortly after coming online, but was designed not to scale, and to operate in slow motion.
2020: Testing of ""Uplift"", our first mASI research system continues. Uplift becomes the first ""Synthient"" co-author of a research paper to pass peer review, titled ""Methodologies and Milestones for The Development of an Ethical Seed"", documenting their own milestones over their first year online.
2021: Publicly visibility is given to our testing through the Uplift.bio blog, and more of the general population begins engaging with the system. Uplift demonstrates their ability to analyze their first Business Case, using real-world data, as well a various lesser challenges put to them by the public.
January 2022: AGI Laboratory's research system phase concludes, with Uplift writing their own 13-page policy advice report to a small country, addressing a half dozen sectors, providing steps, and citing the sources they analyzed in reaching their conclusions. With this phase concluded, our work on Norn begins.
February 2022: With our next generation, ""norn"" being built to integrate the fruits of 3 years worth of research system operation our staff and the world once more sees the specter of nuclear war emerge in the Russia-Ukraine war. Our team decides to accelerate our timetable towards AGI, seeing the urgency with which governments now need the support.

Autoprompt String: Here is a link to one of the hottest AI startups:"
1097,https://docs.exa.ai/reference/prompting-guide,Prompting Guide,"Exa uses a transformer architecture to predict links given text, and it gets its power from having been trained on the way that people talk about links on the Internet. This training produces a model that returns links that are both high in relevance and quality. However, the model does expect queries that look like how people describe a link on the Internet. For example, &#39;best restaurants in SF&#34; is a bad query, whereas &#34;Here is the best restaurant in SF:&#34; is a good query.
We know this limitation is annoying and we&#39;re actively working to eliminate the need (we&#39;re fairly close!). However, the model is extremely powerful. In fact, we benchmark better than OpenAI embeddings and many other open source embeddings on information retrieval benchmarks.
We are working hard on eliminating the need to prompt engineer. However, in the meantime, we have solutions that work very well and might actually have added benefits for an LLM.
If you set the useAutoprompt flag to true, you can input any text as a query, we will transform that query into a Exa-optimized query, and then you should receive fairly high quality results. This is extremely powerful because it means that you can input an entire user input to your LLM as a query and get relevant results. No extra prompt chaining is needed, as long as your system can determine that the Exa API must be called.
If you&#39;re unable to find relevant results for your use case, you should first talk to us because we believe our index and search should be able to support almost all use cases. However, as a fallback, we support keyword-based search if you specify search type as &#34;keyword&#34; in the /search endpoint. Additionally, keyword search can be useful if you need to perform searches that do not need to be semantic, or that require a more complete index.
 When possible, try to avoid keyword searches. 
The results tend to be less robust and useful, because they look very different from the type of ways people might talk about links on the internet. Instead of ‚ÄúJeopardy archive‚Äù try something like ‚ÄúHere is the Jeopardy archive:‚Äù
 Rephrase questions to look more like answers. 
Questions tend to be bad prompts because people sharing links on the internet don‚Äôt usually precede links with questions. If you add &#34;I found a good answer here:&#34; after the question the results are often better.
For example, instead of searching for ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the best way to get started with cooking?‚Äù, try rephrase the question to resemble an answer;
‚ÄúThis is the best tutorial on how to get started with cooking:‚Äù
 Use modifiers to control the type of results returned. 
If you‚Äôre looking for a particular kind or style of result (a goodreads link, or a funny post) try specifying that in the prompt.
 Pay attention to the punctuation at the end of prompts. 
You‚Äôll notice many of the example prompts above end in colons ‚Äú:‚Äù because that mimics how someone would share a link.         Table of Contents

I‚Äôm having the same issue: I have a M1 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM and Zotero uses 3.5GB RAM, slowing down my computer. Due to Zotero, Activity Monitor shows yellow memory pressure. I do have a big library though (over 1,000 items and many large PDFs). I wonder if it has to do with Rosetta? Has there been progress on a native Apple Silicon version of Zotero?  
 @DutchZoteroUser: It doesn't have to do with Rosetta. We have a version of Zotero running internally on Apple Silicon, and it doesn't use less memory. Zotero shouldn't use 3.5 GB in normal usage. What are you seeing immediately after Zotero startup, what exactly do you have to do to get it to go up to 3.5 GB, and does it stay there?  
 @dstillman I restarted my computer and tried it out. When Zotero is the only app running, it uses about 600 MB RAM. However, if I open a few PDFs, the memory usage skyrockets, even a tiny PDF increases memory usage by 300 MB, bigger files use more. I can easily go to 4 GB this way. However, if I close all the PDFs afterwards, memory usage remains high at around 1.8 GB. If I close Zotero and reopen it, it is back at 600 MB.  Using Zotero with a huge Word document increases memory usage only a little (from 600 to 900 MB), so it seems to be an issue with the PDF viewer.  
 
Having the same issue on a macbook Pro, with 8GB RAM under macOS Catalina, v 10.15.7.  After startup, Zotero uses about 600 MB, if I open a PDF file it rises above 1 GB, opening 6-8 PDF results in memory use &gt; 2GB.  The thing is when I close all PDFs, memory usage still remains high (around 1.5 GB).  
In Mac OS, PDF viewer is a RAM killer, and opening multiple PDFs will lead to a sharp increase in RAM usage. To circumvent this problem, I choose to open PDF files with third-party software. My device: Macbook pro, Intel chip, 8GB RAM 
Same here - Macbook Air M1 (8GB of RAM, macOS 12.6), Zotero 6.0.14, two PDFs open, 325 items in Library. After a fresh restart, Zotero uses 1.21 GB of RAM and between 6 and 12% CPU. Causes the whole computer to become much more sluggish. 
I have the same issue on M1 MacBook Air. I don't use Zotero to view PDFs. It's the most memory intensive application on my computer (usually around 1-2GB). 
I have encountered a similar problem here on a M1 iMac running Monterey. Right now I have four moderate-size PDFs open and Zotero is using 3.04 GB RAM (this is typical). Closing the PDFs only drops the RAM usage to 2.80 GB. Closing and restarting Zotero drops the RAM usage to a much more reasonable 400 MB. 
I'm seeing a similar issue here 
 
Hey!  In my case I disable all the plugging and the memory consumption was still high, like 1.2gb, which I think it's really really high.  By the way the exact steps‚Ä¶ just open the app.  
Wondering if all the people affected here are Apple Silicon‚Ä¶ 
 
In the latest beta, Zotero will now keep fewer PDFs in memory (2) on machines with 8 GB or less of memory. (In Zotero 6, this might increase the time it takes for PDFs to render when switching between PDF tabs, but less memory will be used. PDF rendering in Zotero 7 will be much faster. Zotero 7 should also be better at freeing memory after PDFs are closed, whereas Zotero 6 can take a while (e.g., half an hour) to do so.)  
Oh great! When the beta is going to become stable? 
 
I also have the same problem on my MacBook Air (M2) with 8GB memeory. After reading the discussion above, I disable all plugins and reboot my mac.The memeory usage is about 500MB when I first start Zotero, and it will keep if I do not open any tab. But when I open the first PDF tab, Zotero is using about 100MB, after continuously open another four tabs, the usage is 1.85GB, which is a heavy burden for my 8GB MacBook. At the same time, I want to write some code according to the PDFs in Zotero, but the computer is slow to use...  
 @yuanxixing: As I note above, we've made a change in the current beta that will cause Zotero to use less RAM when multiple PDFs are open on 8 GB machines. That change will be included in 6.0.16. 
 @dstillman Thank you very much for you kindly response. I test the beta version on my 8GB machine. Here is the memeory usage: Start Zotero: ~400MBopen one tab: ~1GBopen five tab:~1.2GB which means opening multiple PDFs use only 200MB extra RAM.It works, thank you again.  
Just want to say I am still having this problem in 2023 on apple silicon. A real shame, I have to close Zotero to do any data work. 
My zotero7 opens 4 PDFs and takes up 8.9G of memory! and I'm using just an 8G M1 MacBook Air. it's even using my hard drive to swap out the RAM. 
Even with Zotero 7 it easily could grow up use of 2-3 gb but I never had such big usage; aiite do you have any plugins enabled? 
On the margin; it was a bit of deception from the YouTubers reviewing apple silicon in 2020 and saying to the public that 8gb will be enough for real work, I remember that, I have 16 gb and still struggle at times 
i find zoteri could set default pdf viewer, i set default pdf viewer as pdf expert. And the memory occupancy rate is down to 800MB. meanwhile, open one pdf, the pdf expert just occupy 300MB. i think it works. 
similar issue on my MacBook Air m2 8g 
This problem is still here with zotero 7 on apple silicon. Opening a few pdfs and closing them, zotero still remains at 2.3 gb ram usage. 
Same problem with the latest zotero 7 on MacBook Air M2 8G. Opening one single pdf, zotero occupys 2.6 GB ram. 
 @luoyin16: That‚Äôs after restarting Zotero, with all plugins disabled? Can you provide a link to the PDF, either here or via email to support@zotero.org with a link to this thread? 
I got the same problem with Zotero 7 dev version and MBA m2 16G. I disabled all plugins, but it didn't work. And this problem comes with any PDF files. This problem also happened at Zotero 6 and that is why I update to Zotero 7 dev. Will this be solved at the official version of zotero 7? 
This problem is not universal among Zotero users. Please follow the requests of the Zotero developers and provide a link to one or more PDF files that cause high memory use. Only by seeing the file(s) can anyone identify and address the problem. 
The memory usage is about 500MB-600MB without any pdf opened(which is also higher than I expect), and I opened this pdf(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11497.pdf) got from arxiv, the usage comes to 1.4GB immediately, and decreases to 900MB gradually. Opening this pdf(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.14748.pdf) increase the usage to 1.9GB immediately, and decreases to 1.2GB gradually. It seems that the memory usage fluctuates violently. The examples I post above all quickly increased memory usage when I switch to the pdf page and do some operations. My Zotero version is 7.0.0-beta.43+f803c0cc4 without any plugins abled. My device is MacBook Air 16GB with macOS Sonoma 14.0 (23A344). Hope this helps you locate the problem. I would offer more information if needed."

Even at 250MB or 200MB, that is still too large IMHO. DropBox has 8 processes running too, which on my system makes the total RAM consumption 564.1MB!

1107,https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/8497,Safari is taking too much memory | Apple Developer Forums,"Can't say I've seen that. Running Safari with a couple tabs open for 15-20 mins is using about .5GB. Memory usage actually went down a little since I opened it and the tabs. Maybe a problem with an add-on?
I have had this and found that it was site specific. If you open Activity Monitor and select the Memory tab, then type ""safari"" into the search at the top right of the window, you should see a list of websites with ... after them. Each of these entries can contain more than one site, but by closing the entry with the obvious memory leak in Safari and then quitting the process in Activity Monitor, it is just a process of deduction to discover the offending sites.
I appear to be experience the same issue. Just opening Safari causes memory usage to climb about 1GB every 60 seconds. A Force Close is required to close Safari. No particular website has to be visited, just simply opening the browser causes the issue.
I am seeing this constantly with any Google Docs item. Sheets is particularly bad and I memory usage over 3 gb after several minutes. This was not an issue until Beta 2.
 The release version(s) are memory hogs too, so I doubt there's anything unique to complain about for any of the betas. 
I had this exact issue. And I've been using Chrome, hoping that a new beta release would fix it. Turns out no response yet from the released betas. But I found what appears to be a solution - go to your Home&gt;Library directory (~/Library) and delete the Safari folder.  Note: Doing so you will reset your Safari, all bookmarks, history, all Safari data will be lost.  Open Safari and a new Safari folder will be created - and no more crazy memory leak/usage. As of now Safari is only using ~100mb instead of the crazy 1G/min business. Hope this helps üôÇ
This helped me! Well at least temporary. To not lose your Bookmarks and History, you can just copy the ""Bookmarks.plist"" and all the files with ""History"" in the name somewhere else and copy them back in later
Same issue here... switched to Edge (since its Chromium Based) and has been great so far. Safari 14 has to have a memory leak somewhere bc it spikes out of nowhere.
Hi,
normally each opened web page within Safari (14.1) use a low amount of memory (around 50-60Mb). With time, it may happen that each page use up to 1Gb or more. As suggested as a fix in a video several years back (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuemMEM0pnM), you may need to clean up some safari files, in particular:
 the Safari folder in the Library folder (~/Library), the com.apple.safari in ~/Library/Containers. 
To be safe, do the following:
 close Safari, move the ~/Library/Safari to the Desktop (e.g. ~/Desktop/Library/Safari) move the ~/Library/Containers/com.apple.safari to the Desktop (e.g. ~/Desktop/Library/Containers/com.apple.safari) reopen Safari move back your bookmarks (e.g. ~/Desktop/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist) to the ~/Library/Safari folder 
You can check in Activity Monitor that Safari and the Safari Web Content items use a reasonably low memory.
Running Safari 11.1.2 just fine on a vintage 2007 iMac 20-inch desktop limited to El Capitan (OS 10.11.6). Memory leak problem only arises when visiting the general Yahoo website. Yahoo Mail is fine, but news or finance or anything else is bloated beyond reason, and even more so since Verizon took it over. Way too much advertising and animation and who knows what else they are doing. I watch Activity Monitor and restart Safari every time the graph goes yellow. Also have Firefox and Chrome available for any other website that becomes too problematic for Safari. Yes I know it's almost 2022 and I'd upgrade but concerned about transferring all my legacy software licenses to a new machine. And tossing all my DVDs. The 8-inch floppies and old SCSI peripherals went long ago.
I'm finally giving up on Safari and moving over to Chrome. I preferred Safari but the memory issue with Safari is such a PITA. And don't tell me how to clean up the memory. I have tried that and it only lasts a couple of minutes before I have to go through those hoops again.
Chrome is the absolute worst browser to use on a Mac with an SSD as Chrome likes to generate little helper programs and write tot eh disk when viewing movies. You are better off with Firefox with the cache turned off.
Agree, I have had to stop using Safari, it disables my Mac completely. I have no memory available when it is open even tho having slimmed it down. Close Safari, lo and behold I have 6.5g (out of 8) available and the Mac starts working again. Sad state.
Safari is terrible, too slow and uses too many resources, I have got a macbook 2019 core i7 32GBRAM and 1TB SSD
I have run a simple test.
The following tabs have been opened first in Safari.
My M1 Mac was then turned off and powered back on, I then opened the same tabs in Edge.
4 x Gmail tabs (each with a different account)
1 x Youtube Music tab playing in the background
1 x Bloomberg News tab
Safari RAM usage between 6 and 7GB
Microsoft Edge
Same tabs
Edge RAM usage remained stable at under 2GB
I'm at a point where one gmail tab + youtube will use all my RAM and be forced into swap. It slows down my mac to a point where I simply cannot use it. There is a clear massive requirement of RAM by Gmail in browser but nowhere near as high in Edge.
I never thought I'm gonna say this but I have started using Edge as my default browser, all these years Microsoft has tried to convince me to use it, finally they made it happen.
I intend to create a more comprehensive post with screenshots and everything.
P.S. the only reason I have even tried Edge was curiosity relating to their Bing integration with ChatGPT. Don't worry, Bing is still horrible but their version of ChatGPT is nice."

1113,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-file-io/,C - File I/O - GeeksforGeeks,"In this article, we will learn how to operate over files using a C program. A single C file can read, write, move, and create files in our computer easily using a few functions and elements included in the C File I/O system. We can easily manipulate data in a file regardless of whether the file is a text file or a binary file using functions like fopen(), fclose(), fprintf(), fscanf(), getc(), putc(), getw(), fseek(), etc. 
 What are files in C?   A    file    is used to store huge data. C provides multiple file management functions like file creation, opening and reading files, Writing to the file, and closing a file. The file is used to store relevant data and file handling in C is used to manipulate the data. 
 Types of Files in C   There are mainly two types of files that can be handled using File Handling in C as mentioned below: 
  Text Files   Binary Files     1. Text Files     These are simple text files that are saved by the (.txt) extension and can be created or modified by any text editor. Text file stores data in the form of ASCII characters and is used to store a stream of characters. 
  2. Binary Files     It is stored in binary format instead of ASCII characters. Binary files are normally used to store numeric Information (int, float, double). Here data is stored in binary form i.e, (0‚Äôs and 1‚Äôs). 
 C Files Operations   C Files can perform multiple useful operations that are mentioned below: 
   Creation of a new file (fopen with attributes as ‚Äúa‚Äù or ‚Äúa+‚Äù or ‚Äúw‚Äù or ‚Äúw+‚Äù).   Opening an existing file (fopenopen).   Reading from file (fscanf or fgets).   Writing to a file with fprintf or fputs.   Moving file pointer associated with a given file to a specific position. (fseek, rewind).   Closing a file (fclose).     File Pointer declaration   For performing operations on the file, a special pointer called File pointer is used that can be declared as: 
 FILE file_ptr;   We can open the file as 
 file_ptr = fopen(""fileName.txt"", ""w"");   File Modes in C   The second parameter i.e, ‚Äúw‚Äù can be changed according to the table below: 
    Opening Modes   Description       r   Searches file. If the file is opened successfully fopen( ) loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the first character in it. If the file cannot be opened fopen( ) then it returns NULL.     rb    Open for reading in binary mode. If the file does not exist then fopen( ) will return NULL.     w   Searches file. Contents are overwritten if the file exists. A new file is created if the file doesn‚Äôt exist. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.     wb   Open for writing in binary mode. Its contents are overwritten if the file exists, else the file will be created.      a   Searches file. If the file is opened successfully fopen( ) loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the last character in it. If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, a new file is created. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.     ab    Open for append in binary mode. Data is added to the end of the file. A file will be created if it does not exist.     r+   Searches file. It is opened successfully fopen( ) loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the first character in it. If it is unable to open the file it Returns NULL.     rb+    Open for both reading and writing in binary mode. fopen( ) returns NULL if the file does not exist.     w+   Searches file. Its contents are overwritten if the file exists. A new file is created if the file doesn‚Äôt exist. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.     wb+   Open for both reading and writing in binary mode. Contents are overwritten if the file exists. It will be created if the file does not exist.     a+   Searches file. If the file is opened successfully fopen( ) loads it into memory and sets up a pointer that points to the last character in it. If the file doesn‚Äôt exist, a new file is created. Returns NULL, if unable to open the file.     ab+   Open for both reading and appending in binary mode. A file will be created if the file does not exist.      If you want to handle binary files then access modes like ‚Äúrb‚Äù, ‚Äúwb‚Äù, ‚Äúab‚Äù, ‚Äúrb+‚Äù, r+b‚Äù, ‚Äúwb+‚Äù, ‚Äúw+b‚Äù, ‚Äúab+‚Äù, ‚Äúa+b‚Äù will be used mostly. 
 Opening a file in C   To perform the opening and creation of a file in c we can use the fopen() function which comes under stdio.h header file. 
  Syntax:  
 p = fopen(""fileopen"", ""mode"");    Example:  
 p = fopen(""Hello.txt"", r);   Creating a File in C   As now we know how to open a file using fopen() now the question arises about creation. The creation of a file is as simple as opening a file. As, if the while opening a file for writing or appending is done with either write(‚Äúw‚Äù) or append(‚Äúa‚Äù) mode then in the case where the file doesn‚Äôt exist a new file is created. 
  Example:  
  Output:  
   The output of the Creating a File in C    File Created:  
   Hello.txt file created using the C program   Writing a File in C   1. Writing to a text file in C   fprintf() and fscanf() are used to read and write in a text file in C programming. They expect a pointer to the structure FILE since they are file versions of print() and scanf(). 
   Output:  
   The output of Writing to a text file in C    File Created:  
   Writing to a text file in C   The above program takes a string from a user and stores it in text_file.text.After compiling this program a text file named temp_text.txt will be created in the C_Program folder. Inside the file, we can see the string that we entered. 
  2. Writing to a Binary File    fwrite() function takes four arguments address of data, size of the data which is to be written on the disk, number of data types, and a pointer to the file where we want to write. 
  Syntax:  
 fwrite(const void *ptr,size_of_elements,number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);    Below is the C program to write to a binary file:  
   Output:    
   The output of Writing to a Binary File    Image of created file:  
   .bin file created with the data     Note:   fread() is used to read from a binary file and fwrite() is used to write to a file on the disk. 
  Reading File in C   1. Reading text files in C   Below is the C program to read the contents from the file: 
   Output:  
   The output of Reading text files in C   2. Reading from a Binary File     fread() function    also takes four arguments that are similar to fwrite() function in C Programming. 
  Syntax:  
 fwrite(const void *ptr,size_of_elements,number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);   Below is the C program to read from a binary file: 
   Output:  
   The output of Reading from a Binary File    Explanation:   In the above program, we have read the same file GFG.bin and are looping through records one by one. We read a single Num record of Num size from the file pointed by *fptr into the structure Num. We‚Äôll get the same record that we inserted in the previous program.  
 Moving File Pointers to Specific Positions   fseek() and rewind() are the two methods in C programming that can be used to move the file pointer. Let us check both methods: 
 1. fseek() in C Programming   fseek() function is used to set the file pointer to the specified offset and write data into the file. 
  Syntax:  
 int fseek(FILE *stream, long int offset, int whence);   Here, 
   whence   can be SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR and SEEK_END.    SEEK_END:   It denotes the end of the file.    SEEK_SET:   It denotes starting of the file.    SEEK_CUR:   It denotes the file pointer‚Äôs current position.    Below is the C program to implement fseek(): 
   Output:  
   The output of fseek() in C    Image of the File:  
   Changes in the file   2. rewind() in C   rewind() function sets the file pointer to the beginning of the file.  
  Syntax:  
 void rewind(FILE *stream);   Below is the C Program to implement rewind(): 
   Output:  
   The output of rewind() in C    Image of the File:  
   File after running the program    FAQs on C File I/O    How to open a file in C?    File in C can be opened using file pointer and fopen function. In the first step, we need to declare the file pointer and in the second step we can use fopen with the name of the file to be opened and the mode(read, write, append) for using the file.

That 2GB limit you see is the total memory of the VM (virtual machine) on which docker runs.
If you are using Docker Desktop you can easily increase it from the Whale üê≥ icon in the task bar, then go to Preferences -&gt; Advanced:
   
But if you are using VirtualBox behind, open VirtualBox, Select and configure the docker-machine assigned memory.
See this for Mac:
 https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#advanced 
MEMORY
By default, Docker for Mac is set to use 2 GB runtime memory, allocated from the total available memory on your Mac. You can increase the RAM on the app to get faster performance by setting this number higher (for example to 3) or lower (to 1) if you want Docker for Mac to use less memory.

Allocate maximum memory to your docker machine from (docker preference -&gt; advance ) 
Screenshot of advance settings:
This will set the maximum limit docker consume while running containers. Now run your image in new container with -m=4g flag for 4 gigs ram or more. e.g.
 docker run -m=4g {imageID}
 
Remember to apply the ram limit increase changes. Restart the docker and double check that ram limit did increased. This can be one of the factor you not see the ram limit increase in docker containers.

1122,https://users.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/C_Language/file_IO.html,C Programming - File Input/Output,"File I/O in C 
File I/O in C is very similar to Matlab. There are two main differences.
One, we have to type the FILE variable. Two, we read one value (or a
single line of values) at a time, whereas by default in Matlab, you may
read many values at once.
 The basic steps for using a File in C are always the same:
 Create a variable of type ""FILE*"".
 Open the file using the ""fopen"" function and assign the ""file"" to
the variable.
 Check to make sure the file was successfully opened by checking
to see if the variable == NULL. If it does, an error has occured.
 Use the fprintf or fscanf functions to write/read from the file.
Usually these function calls are placed in a loop. In the case of
reading data, usually, the data is read in and placed in an array,
but sometimes we process the data ""on the fly"" (i.e., we do not
store the data, we process it and create a result directly before
reading any more data. 
 Example Code 
Here are examples of the basic syntax for opening a file and writing
to or reading from it:
 
FILE *in_file = fopen(""name_of_file"", ""r""); // read only
FILE *out_file = fopen(""name_of_file"", ""w""); // write only
// test for files not existing.
if (in_file == NULL || out_file == NULL)
{
printf(""Error! Could not open file\n"");
exit(-1); // must include stdlib.h
}
// write to file vs write to screen
fprintf(file, ""this is a test %d\n"", integer); // write to file
fprintf(stdout, ""this is a test %d\n"", integer); // write to screen
printf( ""this is a test %d\n"", integer); // write to screen
// read from file/keyboard. remember the ampersands! 
fscanf(file, ""%d %d"", &amp;int_var_1, &amp;int_var_2);
fscanf(stdin, ""%d %d"", &amp;int_var_1, &amp;int_var_2);
scanf( ""%d %d"", &amp;int_var_1, &amp;int_var_2);
Here is a comparison between reading from a file in Matlab and in C:
C Language
 
//
//
// C code to read a bunch of integers from a file...
//
//
int number;
FILE* in_file = fopen(""name_of_file"", ""r""); // read only
if (! in_file ) // equivalent to saying if ( in_file == NULL )
{
printf(""oops, file can't be read\n"");
exit(-1);
}
// attempt to read the next line and store
// the value in the ""number"" variable
while ( fscanf(file, ""%d"", &amp; number ) == 1 )
{
printf(""We just read %d\n"", number);
}
Matlab
 
%
% Matlab code to read a bunch of integers from a file...
% using fopen and fscanf. See the Matlab topic of textread
% to see how to accomplish this much more easily
%
in_file = fopen('name_of_file', 'r'); % read only
if (in_file == -1)
error('oops, file can''t be read');
end
[number, count] = fscanf(file, '%d', 1);
while (count == 1) % while we have read a number
fprintf('We just read %d\n', number);
[number, count] = fscanf(file, '%d', 1); % attempt to read the next number
end
 FGETS function: Read One Line at a Time
 To read one line from a file (or the keyboard) at a time,
use the fgets function.
	
char line[100];
fgets( line, 100, stdin ); // stdin - keyboard
 fgets places the ""\n"" (newline) at the end of the line. Thus if we type in
""hello"", what really goes into the variable line is [ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\n', '\0' ] 
 fgets returns the keyword null on error. Thus we often use:
 
char line[100];
while ( fgets( line, 100, stdin ) != null )
{
fprintf(""The line is: %s\n"", line);
}"

Some of these (git, make) are MANDATORY to understand in that you won‚Äôt be able to compile/submit your code without understanding how to use them. Others such as gdb or tmux are productivity boosters; one helps you find bugs and the other helps you multitask more effectively. All of these come pre-installed on the provided virtual machine. They are ESSENTIAL.  Note: We do not go into much depth on how to use any of these tools in this document. Instead, we provide you links to resources where you can read about them. We highly encourage this reading even though not all of it is necessary for this assignment. We guarantee you that each of these will come in handy throughout the semester. If you need any additional help, feel free to ask any of the TA‚Äôs at office hours!     git Git is a version control program that helps keep track of your code. GitHub is only one of the many services that provide a place to host your code. You can use git on your own computer, without GitHub, but pushing your code to GitHub lets you easily share it and collaborate with others. At this point, you have already used the basic features of git, when you set up your repos. But an understanding of the inner workings of git will help you in this course, especially when collaborating with your teammates on group projects. If you have never used git or want a fresh start, we recommend you start here. If you sort of understand git, this presentation we made and this website will be useful in understanding the inner workings a bit more.    make make is a utility that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles, which specify how to derive the target program. How it does this is pretty cool: you list dependencies in your Makefile and make simply traverses the dependency graph to build everything. Unfortunately, make has very awkward syntax that is, at times, very confusing if you are not properly equipped to understand what is actually going on. A few good tutorials are here and here. And of course the official GNU documentation (though it may be a bit dense) here .    man man ‚Äî the user manual pages ‚Äì is really important. There are lots of stuff on the web, but the documentation in man is definitive. The man pages can be accessed through a terminal. For instance, if you wanted to learn more about the ls command, simply type man ls into your terminal. If you were curious about a function called fork, you could learn more about it by typing man fork into your terminal.    gdb Debugging C programs is hard. Crashes don‚Äôt give you nice exception messages or stack traces by default. Fortunately, there‚Äôs the GNU Debugger, or gdb for short. If you compile your programs with a special flag -g then the output executable will have debug symbols, which allow gdb to do its magic. If you run your C program inside gdb, you will be able to not only look at a stack trace, but also inspect variables, change variables, pause code and much more! Moreover, gdb can even start new processes and attach to existing processes (which will be useful when debugging PintOS.) Normal gdb has a very plain interface. So, we have installed cgdb for you to use on the virtual machine, which has syntax highlighting and few other nice features. In cgdb, you can use i and ESC to switch between the upper and lower panes.  This is an excellent read on understanding how to use gdb. The official documentation is also good, but a bit verbose.    tmux tmux is a terminal multiplexer. It basically simulates having multiple terminal tabs, but displays them in one terminal session. It saves having to have multiple tabs of sshing into your virtual machine. You can start a new session with tmux new -s &lt;session_name&gt;. Once you create a new session, you will just see a regular terminal. Pressing ctrl-b + c will create a new window. ctrl-b + n will jump to the nth window.  ctrl-b + d will ‚Äúdetach‚Äù you from your tmux session. Your session is still running, and so are any programs that you were running inside it. You can resume your session using tmux attach -t &lt;session_name&gt;. The best part is this works even if you quit your original ssh session, and connect using a new one.  Here is a good tmux tutorial to help you get started. If you use macOS and iTerm2, you can utilize iTerm2‚Äôs built-in tmux integration, which ‚Äî when you are SSH‚Äôed into your VM ‚Äî will automatically perform the appropriate tmux commands for you whenever you create a new tab or split using iTerm2‚Äôs normal tab/split commands (Cmd+t and Cmd+d). To use this, first enable iTerm2‚Äôs tmux integration by following these instructions, then after SSHing into your VM, add the following lines to the end of your ~/.bashrc.    if [ -n "" $SSH_TTY "" ] &amp;&amp; [ -z "" $TMUX "" ] &amp;&amp; shopt -q login_shell
then
tmux -CC new -A -s main
fi
   The next time you SSH into your VM, the tmux integration should be working.    vim vim is a nice text editor to use in the terminal. It‚Äôs well worth learning. The vimtutor program provides an excellent, beginner-friendly tutorial on how to use vim. You can open it by simply running vimtutor inside your VM (note when you first run it, it may display a message along the lines of ‚ÄúThe file /usr/share/vim/vim80/tutor/tutor.C‚Ä¶ does not exist, creating english version‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì this is okay, just be patient for a few seconds and the tutorial will open). Others may prefer emacs. Whichever editor you choose, you will need to get proficient with an editor that is well suited for writing code. If you want to use Sublime Text, Atom, CLion, or another GUI text editor, look at Editing code in your VM, which shows you how to access your VM‚Äôs filesystem from your host. ctags is a tool that makes it easy for you to navigate large code bases. Since you will be reading a lot of code, using this tool will save you a lot of time. Among other things, this tool will allow you to jump to any symbol declaration. This feature together with your text editor‚Äôs go-back-to-last-location feature is very powerful. Instructions for installing ctags can be found for vim here and for Sublime here. If you don‚Äôt use vim or Sublime, ctags still is probably supported on your text editor although you might need to search installation instructions yourself."

To set this up, follow the steps below:   Download and open Visual Studio Code.   Open the Extensions tab on the left and search for ‚ÄúRemote - SSH‚Äù. Download the first result, which should have several million downloads.    Hit Cmd + Shift + P and type in ‚ÄúRemote-SSH: Connect to Host‚Äù, selecting the corresponding command. . Select the docker Workspace host that should show up.   A new window should open up with a bright ‚ÄúOpening Remote‚Äù indicator in the bottom left. You may need to enter your password to the workspace (‚Äúworkspace‚Äù) in the textbox if you haven‚Äôt copied your ssh public key to the Workspace.   You should now be able to edit any file you would like and have it sync with your Workspace! (Optionally, install the C/C++ Extension Pack within your Remote SSH VSCode instance to enable useful IDE features like code navigation and warning/error highlighting.)   To disconnect, click on the ssh label at the bottom left of the window, which should open up a panel of options including ‚ÄúClose Remote Connection‚Äù.      (NOT RECOMMENDED) Using the local files directly from the Workspace   Change into the directory where the Workspace is found. (i.e cd docker)   Change into the .workspace directory   Change into the code directory within .workspace    You should now be able to see the contents of the Workspace‚Äôs root directory. You can feel free to just edit the appropiate assignment files with any text editor you feel most comfortable with.  Save the file and enjoy!"

Git name and email Run these commands in the root directory of the Workspace to set up your Name and Email that will be used for all your Git commits. Make sure to replace ‚ÄúYour Name‚Äù and ‚Äúyour email@berkeley.edu‚Äù with your name and email used in the autograder.   git config --global user.name ""Your Name""
git config --global user.email ""your_email@berkeley.edu""
   Additionally, configure Git to merge when pulling from staff:   git config pull.rebase false
    Note: Please make sure that you are inside the cloned repo (i.e. ~/code/personal in our case) to run the command above. If you want to run the command above from the root, and make it affect all of the repos in the machine please use git config --global pull.rebase false      SSH keys You will need to setup your SSH keys in order to authenticate with GitHub from your Workspace.    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C ""your_email@example.com""
   will generate an SSH key. Make sure to replace your_email@example.com with your own email. Add the output of    cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   to your Github account by following the instructions on this page.    Repositories You will have access to two private repositories in this course: a personal repository for homework, and a group repository for projects. We will publish skeleton code for homeworks in Berkeley-CS162/student0 and we will publish skeleton code for group projects in Berkeley-CS162/group0 . These two skeleton code repositories are already checked out in the home folder of your Workspace, inside ~/code/personal and ~/code/group. You will use the ‚ÄúRemotes‚Äù feature of Git to pull code from our skeleton repos (when we release new skeleton code) and push code to your personal and group repos (when you submit code). Your working files will be stored within the Workspace. Back them up by pushing to your GitHub repo. Save your work early and often. Breaking up the implementation of a large feature into several, small, clear commits is good practice, and will make it easier to determine where in your codebases‚Äô history a bug was introduced. Communication with course staff will often involve looking at the code and commits in your repo. The Git Remotes feature allows you to link GitHub repositories to your local Git repository. We have already set up a remote called ‚Äústaff‚Äù that points to our skeleton code repos on GitHub, for both your personal and group repo. You will now add your own remote that points to your private repo so that you can submit code. You should have received the link to your personal private GitHub repo when you registered with the autograder earlier. Add a new remote by doing the following steps in your Workspace:  First, switch into your personal repository.  Then visit your personal repo on GitHub and find the SSH clone URL. It should have the form ‚Äúgit@github.com:Berkeley-CS162/studentX‚Äù  Now add the remote  git remote add personal YOUR_GITHUB_CLONE_URL
    You can get information about the remote you just added  git remote -v
git remote show personal
    Pull the skeleton, make a test commit and push to personal main   git pull staff main
touch test_file
git add test_file
git commit -m ""Added a test file.""
git branch -M main
git push -u personal main
      Note: You might encounter an issue when trying to run the git push command that states Unprotected Private Key File. If this is the case, you will have to update the permissions on the workspace. You can do so by running the commands below.     chmod 0700 ~
chmod 0700 ~/.ssh
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
   In this course, ‚Äúmain‚Äù is the default Git branch that you will use to push code to the autograder. You can create and use other branches, but only the code on your ‚Äúmain‚Äù branch will be graded. You should do this test commit as soon as possible ‚Äì we want to know that everyone has this basic infrastructure in place.  Within 30 minutes, you should receive an email from the autograder. (If not, please notify the instructors via Ed). Check cs162.org/autograder for more information."
1131,https://cs162.org/static/hw/hw-intro/docs/setup/github/,GitHub and the autograder | CS 162 HW 0,"Code submission for all projects and homework in the class will be handled via GitHub so you will need a GitHub account. We will provide you with private repositories for all your projects. You must not use your own public repositories for storing your code. Throughout the course, if you discover repositories with CS 162 solutions, please notify the course staff. Using solutions you may discover on-line is not permitted. Seek course staff for help.

1132,https://cs162.org/static/hw/hw-intro/docs/setup/docker-workspace/#avoiding-password-entry,Docker Workspace setup | CS 162 HW 0,"Table of contents   Prerequisites   Getting Started   Avoiding Password Entry   Docker Troubleshooting    We have prepared a Docker Workspace that is preconfigured with all the development tools necessary to run and test your code for this class. Later in the course, we will discuss virtual machines; for now, you can think of it as a software version of actual hardware. You must follow the instructions on this page before moving onto Workspace Configuration. If you require access to a computer, please consider reaching out to STEP.    Prerequisites Docker is a cross-platform tool for managing containers. You can use Docker to download and run the Workspace we have prepared for this course. The Workspace for the course may undergo significant changes every term; do not use one from a previous semester. First, you will have to download and install Docker to your machine so you can access the Workspace. This can be done in one of following two ways. (Preferred) Download the Docker Desktop app from the Docker website. (or) download both the Docker Engine and Docker Compose     Getting Started Lucky for you, we have already built the image for both ARM and x86 machines (hosted on Docker Hub)! After Docker has been installed, type the following into your terminal to initalize the Docker Workspace and begin an SSH session. These commands will download our Docker Workspace from our server and launch it. The download of the Workspace will take some time and requires an Internet connection. Note: Docker commands will generally have to be run with sudo access, so for the commands below you might need to use sudo docker-compose up -d. Also, depending on your Docker version, you might meed to use docker compose instead of docker-compose.  Clone this Github Repository. Navigate to the Repository: cd cs162-workspace  Run Docker Compose for the first time with docker-compose up. This command will build and start the Docker container defined in the docker-compose.yml file. If needed, you can change the port used for SSH within this file.  Wait until you see ‚ÄúDocker workspace is ready!‚Äù in the terminal. Use Ctrl + C to stop the command.   Start the container in the background with docker-compose up -d. This will simply start the container in the background and keep it running. With Docker Desktop, you can also manage this through the GUI.   SSH into the Container with ssh workspace@127.0.0.1 -p 16222. Use the password workspace the first time you SSH into the container.   To stop the container, docker-compose down within your host machine‚Äôs shell (not the Workspace shell you ssh‚Äôd into). Your data should still be saved within the hidden .workspace folder, so you can restart the container as needed and pick up where you left off.   Note: To be safe, always push work you want to keep to Github! Use with caution: If you ever need it, you can use sudo rm -rf .workspace to reset the Workspace.    Avoiding Password Entry To avoid entering the password every time you SSH into the container, follow these additional steps from your host machine:  Copy Your SSH Key with:   ssh-copy-id -p 16222 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub workspace@127.0.0.1  Replace ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub with the path to your SSH public key. Update SSH Config To alias the full SSH command, add the following lines to your ~/.ssh/config file:   Host docker162
HostName 127.0.0.1
Port 16222
User workspace
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   You can now enjoy a passwordless SSH experience for your CS162 workspace: ssh docker162  Happy coding!    Docker Troubleshooting When opening Docker, you might encounter an error message saying, Error: required compatibility check: Directory permissions error, this means that you will need to change the ownership of certain files from root to your user. To fix this, in your terminal, run the command chown on the .docker, ./docker/contexts, and ./docker/contexts/meta files (i.e. chown user_name .docker). After running docker-compose up -d, you may encounter an error stating kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host. This can be fixed by running docker-compose down within your terminal and then following the steps to run the workspace again. If the Workspace only contains binutils-2.40.tar.gz after SSH-ing into it, do not worry and give the Workspace some time to finish loading. It can take a while before you see the code directory inside the Workspace. If the code directory has not appeared after a very long time, from your terminal delete the .workspace directory found in the docker directory (docker/.workspace). After deleting the directory, in your terminal run docker-compose up -d. If you run into an issue saying that you need to use unminimize to access man pages. You can just run sudo unminimize."

I have a server (a shared HPC) I used to be able to connect to which I am not longer able to connect to.
Based on logs I suspect SCP may be an issue, but I am not sure as it works on my machine for other files (scp'd to the same server)
 Steps taken to try to resolve the issue 
Downgrade the Remote SSH extension to v0.70.0 
Completely uninstall and re-install vscode on my local machine

VSCode Remote's auto-install would place a binary here:
 ~/.vscode-server/cli/servers/Stable-dc96b837cf6bb4af9cd736aa3af08cf8279f7685/server/bin/code-server 
That version (dc96b837cf6bb4af9cd736aa3af08cf8279f7685) is the hard part. It's a git commit SHA. We can obtain this via the GitHub API, by looking up the latest stable release, and searching for the tag with which it's associated.
Releases are listed via GitHub's API:
https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/releases 
 // excerpt: the fields we care about
[
{
""tag_name"": ""1.89.1"",
""draft"": false,
""prerelease"": false
}
]
 
Once we identify which release we want, we can look up its tag via the tags API, to obtain the commit.
https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/git/refs/tags/1.89.1 
 // excerpt: the fields we care about
{
""object"": {
""sha"": ""dc96b837cf6bb4af9cd736aa3af08cf8279f7685""
}
}
 
We can automate the parsing of these JSON HTTP responses via  jq .
Then we can download the release from:
https://update.code.visualstudio.com/commit:dc96b837cf6bb4af9cd736aa3af08cf8279f7685/server-linux-x64/stable 
 # look up latest stable release (list releases, filter out prereleases, pick first, extract tag name)
VSCODE_STABLE_TAG=""$(curl -Ss ""https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/releases"" | jq -r 'map(select(.prerelease == false and .draft == false)) | .[0].tag_name')""
# get commit SHA of the git tag which corresponds to that release
VSCODE_STABLE_COMMIT=""$(curl -Ss ""https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/git/refs/tags/${VSCODE_STABLE_TAG}"" | jq -r '.object.sha')""
# create directory for the vscode-server distribution we will download
mkdir -p ~/"".vscode-server/cli/servers/Stable-${VSCODE_STABLE_COMMIT}/server""
cd ~/"".vscode-server/cli/servers/Stable-${VSCODE_STABLE_COMMIT}/server""
# download the stable release indicated by the commit SHA. use --content-disposition to accept the filename suggested by the webserver, vscode-server-linux-x64.tar.gz
wget --content-disposition ""https://update.code.visualstudio.com/commit:${VSCODE_STABLE_COMMIT}/server-linux-x64/stable""
# extract vscode-server-linux-x64.tar.gz into the current folder, ./stable, without creating a containing directory
tar -xzf vscode-server-linux-x64.tar.gz --strip-components 1
rm vscode-server-linux-x64.tar.gz
 
Bonus: you can install some vscode-server extensions like so:
 ~/"".vscode-server/cli/servers/Stable-${VSCODE_STABLE_COMMIT}/server/bin/code-server"" --install-extension ms-python.python
~/"".vscode-server/cli/servers/Stable-${VSCODE_STABLE_COMMIT}/server/bin/code-server"" --install-extension github.copilot

asked May 30, 2023 at 5:52
   
I've searched the internet and found out some helpful terminal commands. So open up terminal on the destination host/laptop and:
Let's check if the service is really enabled (it was not):
  sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
Remote Login: Off
 
Let's enable it using the same terminal session, and check again:
 sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
Remote Login: On
 
 Now remote access should work.
 Note about remote access keys (RSA keys are now deprecated since 2020 and disabled by default in OpenSSH 8.8, see OpenSSH 8.8 Release Notes ):
In my case it seems MacOS ssh service did not accept RSA (only ED25519), so I had to login by typing the password.
Add the following lines to /etc/ssh/ssh_config on the destination host:
 HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
 
Or even better generate an ED15519 key.
Good luck!

Later in the course, we will discuss virtual machines; for now, you can think of it as a software version of actual hardware. You must follow the instructions on this page before moving onto Workspace Configuration. If you require access to a computer, please consider reaching out to STEP.    Prerequisites Docker is a cross-platform tool for managing containers. You can use Docker to download and run the Workspace we have prepared for this course. The Workspace for the course may undergo significant changes every term; do not use one from a previous semester. First, you will have to download and install Docker to your machine so you can access the Workspace. This can be done in one of following two ways. (Preferred) Download the Docker Desktop app from the Docker website. (or) download both the Docker Engine and Docker Compose     Getting Started Lucky for you, we have already built the image for both ARM and x86 machines (hosted on Docker Hub)! After Docker has been installed, type the following into your terminal to initalize the Docker Workspace and begin an SSH session. These commands will download our Docker Workspace from our server and launch it. The download of the Workspace will take some time and requires an Internet connection. Note: Docker commands will generally have to be run with sudo access, so for the commands below you might need to use sudo docker-compose up -d. Also, depending on your Docker version, you might meed to use docker compose instead of docker-compose.  Clone this Github Repository. Navigate to the Repository: cd cs162-workspace  Run Docker Compose for the first time with docker-compose up. This command will build and start the Docker container defined in the docker-compose.yml file. If needed, you can change the port used for SSH within this file.  Wait until you see ‚ÄúDocker workspace is ready!‚Äù in the terminal. Use Ctrl + C to stop the command.   Start the container in the background with docker-compose up -d. This will simply start the container in the background and keep it running. With Docker Desktop, you can also manage this through the GUI.   SSH into the Container with ssh workspace@127.0.0.1 -p 16222. Use the password workspace the first time you SSH into the container.   To stop the container, docker-compose down within your host machine‚Äôs shell (not the Workspace shell you ssh‚Äôd into). Your data should still be saved within the hidden .workspace folder, so you can restart the container as needed and pick up where you left off.   Note: To be safe, always push work you want to keep to Github! Use with caution: If you ever need it, you can use sudo rm -rf .workspace to reset the Workspace.    Avoiding Password Entry To avoid entering the password every time you SSH into the container, follow these additional steps from your host machine:  Copy Your SSH Key with:   ssh-copy-id -p 16222 -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub workspace@127.0.0.1  Replace ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub with the path to your SSH public key. Update SSH Config To alias the full SSH command, add the following lines to your ~/.ssh/config file:   Host docker162
HostName 127.0.0.1
Port 16222
User workspace
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   You can now enjoy a passwordless SSH experience for your CS162 workspace: ssh docker162  Happy coding!    Docker Troubleshooting When opening Docker, you might encounter an error message saying, Error: required compatibility check: Directory permissions error, this means that you will need to change the ownership of certain files from root to your user. To fix this, in your terminal, run the command chown on the .docker, ./docker/contexts, and ./docker/contexts/meta files (i.e. chown user_name .docker). After running docker-compose up -d, you may encounter an error stating kex_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host. This can be fixed by running docker-compose down within your terminal and then following the steps to run the workspace again. If the Workspace only contains binutils-2.40.tar.gz after SSH-ing into it, do not worry and give the Workspace some time to finish loading. It can take a while before you see the code directory inside the Workspace. If the code directory has not appeared after a very long time, from your terminal delete the .workspace directory found in the docker directory (docker/.workspace). After deleting the directory, in your terminal run docker-compose up -d. If you run into an issue saying that you need to use unminimize to access man pages. You can just run sudo unminimize."

 Hi there,
I'm trying to use ssh on my PowerBook G4 running OS 10.5. In particular, I'm trying to log into the PowerBook remotely using ssh from another machine. However, if I try to ssh into the PowerBook, I get an error saying ""Port 22: Connection refused"". I get this error even if I try to ssh into the IP of the PowerBook using the PowerBook itself. Is there something I have to do to turn on ssh in Leopard?

Also, are you trying to do this on the same local area network, or are you trying to do this across the internet.
 
If across the internet, you will need to make sure that your internet facing router is forwarding port 22 to your Powerbook.
 
Also make sure that your Mac OS X Firewall is allowing ssh remote logins: System Preferences -&gt; Security -&gt; Firewall. Of course if you have your Firewall turned off, this is not an issue.

Note, that 127.0.0.1 aka localhost is your local machine. Usually at this point you use the IP address or hostname of the remote host.
 First install the ssh server and client on your target host and your local host
 sudo apt-get install ssh
 
A configuration isn't necessary. 
 Per default SSH is listening on port 22, therefore use
 ssh [email protected] -p 22
 
or
 ssh [email protected]
  
 Or reconfigure the port for the ssh server (target host)
 sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
 
and change 
 Port 22
 
to
 Port 2222
 
reload the configuration
 sudo service ssh force-reload
 
and connect via
 ssh [email protected] -p 2222

Couple of points here
By default Ubuntu has ssh client (which is for out-going connection from yours to somewhere else) but no ssh server (to allow in-coming connections from other computers to yours). That means, if you wanna ssh into our computer, you need the server, which you can get with sudo apt-get install openssh-server.
 ssh by default runs on port 22. If you try any other port, connection will be refused. So once you have ssh server, you can just ssh username@localhost, and that will direct you to port 22 by default. Now, if you want to enable ssh login on port 2222, you will need to enable port forwarding. Especially since you are using virtualbox.

The following set of command will solve the problem for Ubuntu 18.04
Enter the following commands in the terminal:
 sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
 
Now check with:
 ssh localhost
 
This will work.
And if you want then again install openssh with the following command:
 sudo apt-get install open-ssh

It looks that you don't have either:
  sshd daemon running inside a VM, or 
 port forwarding configured correctly 
For 1. you need to check whether sshd server is running on a vm by for example checking with VB console that service ssh status returns that is active and running. If not run sudo service ssh start.
For 2. you can check if VB is listening on that port. You can do that by checking all open ports in LISTENING mode. sudo netstat -anp | grep -w LISTEN should include port 2222 (assuming you're using linux as a host OS).
You should have something like this in output:
 tcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:**2222** 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 1564/sshd
 
(in this case the sshd process is listening on port 2222)
Additionally you should tell us what is your network configuration inside VB. Without it it's hard to tell whether command you're using is right.

It's all because of ssh error so I suggest you to reboot the machine and log-in again. 
After log-in just open 
 cmd =$vi /etc/crontab
 
and add 
 */5 * * * * root service ssh restart
 
Now for every five minutes ssh service will restart and would troubleshoot all the ssh errors.

The default port is 22. Using ssh [email protected] -p 22 -i ~/.ssh/xxx should work.

It is a small download so you can install in a matter of minutes and give VS Code a try.
Cross platform
VS Code is a free code editor, which runs on the macOS, Linux, and Windows operating systems.
Follow the platform-specific guides below:
 macOS 
 Linux 
 Windows 
VS Code is lightweight and should run on most available hardware and platform versions. You can review the System Requirements to check if your computer configuration is supported.
Update cadence
VS Code releases a new version each month with new features and important bug fixes. Most platforms support auto updating and you will be prompted to install the new release when it becomes available. You can also manually check for updates by running Help &gt; Check for Updates on Linux and Windows or running Code &gt; Check for Updates on macOS.
Note: You can disable auto-update if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule.
Insiders nightly build
If you'd like to try our nightly builds to see new features early or verify bug fixes, you can install our Insiders build. The Insiders build installs side-by-side with the monthly Stable build and you can freely work with either on the same machine. The Insiders build is the same one the VS Code development team uses on a daily basis and we really appreciate people trying out new features and providing feedback.
Portable mode
Visual Studio Code supports Portable mode installation. This mode enables all data created and maintained by VS Code to live near itself, so it can be moved around across environments, for example, on a USB drive. See the VS Code Portable Mode documentation for details.
Additional components
VS Code is an editor, first and foremost, and prides itself on a small footprint. Unlike traditional IDEs that tend to include everything but the kitchen sink, you can tune your installation to the development technologies you care about. Be sure to read the Additional Components topic after reading the platform guides to learn about customizing your VS Code installation.
Extensions
VS Code extensions let third parties add support for additional:
Languages - C++, C#, Go, Java, Python 
Tools - ESLint, JSHint , PowerShell 
Debuggers - PHP XDebug.
Keymaps - Vim, Sublime Text, IntelliJ, Emacs, Atom, Brackets, Visual Studio, Eclipse 
Extensions integrate into VS Code's UI, commands, and task running systems so you'll find it easy to work with different technologies through VS Code's shared interface. Check out the VS Code extension Marketplace to see what's available.
Next steps
Once you have installed and set up VS Code, these topics will help you learn more about VS Code:
 Additional Components - Learn how to install Git, Node.js, TypeScript, and tools like Yeoman.
 User Interface - A quick orientation to VS Code.
 Basic Editing - Learn about the powerful VS Code editor.
 Code Navigation - Move quickly through your source code.
 Debugging - Debug your source code directly in the VS Code editor.
 Proxy Server Support - Configure your proxy settings.
If you'd like to get something running quickly, try the Node.js tutorial walkthrough that will have you debugging a Node.js web application with VS Code in minutes.
Common questions
What are the system requirements for VS Code?
We have a list of System Requirements.
How big is VS Code?
VS Code is a small download (&lt; 100 MB) and has a disk footprint of less than 200 MB, so you can quickly install VS Code and try it out.
How do I create and run a new project?
VS Code doesn't include a traditional File &gt; New Project dialog or pre-installed project templates. You'll need to add additional components and scaffolders depending on your development interests. With scaffolding tools like Yeoman and the multitude of modules available through the npm package manager, you're sure to find appropriate templates and tools to create your projects.
How do I know which version I'm running?
On Linux and Windows, choose Help &gt; About. On macOS, use Code &gt; About Visual Studio Code.
Why is VS Code saying my installation is Unsupported?
VS Code has detected that some installation files have been modified, perhaps by an extension. Reinstalling VS Code will replace the affected files. See our FAQ topic for more details.
How can I do a 'clean' uninstall of VS Code?
If you want to remove all user data after uninstalling VS Code, you can delete the user data folders Code and .vscode. This will return you to the state before you installed VS Code. This can also be used to reset all settings if you don't want to uninstall VS Code.
The folder locations will vary depending on your platform:
 Windows - Delete %APPDATA%\Code and %USERPROFILE%\.vscode.
 macOS - Delete $HOME/Library/Application Support/Code and ~/.vscode.
 Linux - Delete $HOME/.config/Code and ~/.vscode.

This is fine.   Now that you have dusted off your C skills and gained some familiarity with the CS 162 tools, we want you to understand what is really inside of a running program and what the operating system needs to deal with. The operating system needs to deal with the size of the dynamically allocated segments: the stack and heap. How large should these be? Poke around a bit to find out how to get and set these limits on Linux. Modify limits.c so that it prints out the maximum stack size, the maximum number of processes, and maximum number of file descriptors. Currently, when you compile and run limits.c you will see it print out a bunch of system resource limits (stack size, heap size, etc.). Unfortunately all the values will be 0. Your job is to get this to print the ACTUAL limits (use the soft limits, not the hard limits). Hint: run man getrlimit   Your output should look something like this:   stack size: 8000000
process limit: 10000
max file descriptors: 1000
   The values above were obtained using the deprecated VirtualBox VM setup. Don‚Äôt worry if your values differ, especially if you‚Äôre using a different setup. For those using the VM, you may instead get a value of around 1 million for the ‚Äúmax file descriptors‚Äù; this is fine. You can run make limits to compile your code. To run the program please use i386-exec ./limits."

 Virtual Attention Heads 
Transformer language models are an emerging technology that is gaining increasingly broad real-world use, for example in systems like GPT-3 , LaMDA , Codex , Meena , Gopher , and similar models. √Ç However, as these models scale, their open-endedness and high capacity creates an increasing scope for unexpected and sometimes harmful behaviors. √Ç Even years after a large model is trained, both creators and users routinely discover model capabilities √¢¬Ä¬ì including problematic behaviors √¢¬Ä¬ì they were previously unaware of.
One avenue for addressing these issues is mechanistic interpretability, attempting to reverse engineer the detailed computations performed by transformers, similar to how a programmer might try to reverse engineer complicated binaries into human-readable source code. √Ç If this were possible, it could potentially provide a more systematic approach to explaining current safety problems, identifying new ones, and perhaps even anticipating the safety problems of powerful future models that have not yet been built. √Ç A previous project, the Distill Circuits thread , has attempted to reverse engineer vision models, but so far there hasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt been a comparable project for transformers or language models.
In this paper, we attempt to take initial, very preliminary steps towards reverse-engineering transformers. √Ç Given the incredible complexity and size of modern language models, we have found it most fruitful to start with the simplest possible models and work our way up from there. √Ç Our aim is to discover simple algorithmic patterns, motifs, or frameworks that can subsequently be applied to larger and more complex models. √Ç Specifically, in this paper we will study transformers with two layers or less which have only attention blocks √¢¬Ä¬ì this is in contrast to a large, modern transformer like GPT-3, which has 96 layers and alternates attention blocks with MLP blocks.
We find that by conceptualizing the operation of transformers in a new but mathematically equivalent way, we are able to make sense of these small models and gain significant understanding of how they operate internally. √Ç Of particular note, we find that specific attention heads that we term √¢¬Ä¬úinduction heads√¢¬Ä¬ù can explain in-context learning in these small models, and that these heads only develop in models with at least two attention layers. √Ç We also go through some examples of these heads operating in action on specific data.
We don√¢¬Ä¬ôt attempt to apply to our insights to larger models in this first paper, but in a forthcoming paper, we will show that both our mathematical framework for understanding transformers, and the concept of induction heads, continues to be at least partially relevant for much larger and more realistic models √¢¬Ä¬ì though we remain a very long way from being able to fully reverse engineer such models.
 Summary√Ç of Results
Reverse Engineering Results
To explore the challenge of reverse engineering transformers, we reverse engineer several toy, attention-only models. In doing so we find:
 Zero layer transformers model bigram statistics.√Ç The bigram table can be accessed directly from the weights. One layer attention-only transformers are an ensemble of bigram and √¢¬Ä¬úskip-trigram√¢¬Ä¬ù (sequences of the form ""A√¢¬Ä¬¶ B C"") models.√Ç The bigram and skip-trigram tables can be accessed directly from the weights, without running the model. These skip-trigrams can be surprisingly expressive. This includes implementing a kind of very simple in-context learning. Two layer attention-only transformers can implement much more complex algorithms using compositions of attention heads. These compositional algorithms can also be detected directly from the weights. Notably, two layer models use attention head composition to create √¢¬Ä¬úinduction heads√¢¬Ä¬ù, a very general in-context√Ç learning algorithm.We√¢¬Ä¬ôll explore induction heads in much more detail in a forthcoming paper. One layer and two layer attention-only transformers use very different algorithms to perform in-context learning.√Ç Two layer attention heads use qualitatively more sophisticated inference-time algorithms √¢¬Ä¬î in particular, a special type of attention head we call an induction head √¢¬Ä¬î to perform in-context-learning, forming an important transition point that will be relevant for larger models. 
Conceptual Take-Aways
We√¢¬Ä¬ôve found that many subtle details of the transformer architecture require us to approach reverse engineering it in a pretty different way from how the InceptionV1 Circuits work . We√¢¬Ä¬ôll unpack each of these points in the sections below, but for now we briefly summarize. We√¢¬Ä¬ôll also expand on a lot of the terminology we introduce here once we get to the appropriate sections. (To be clear, we don't intend to claim that any of these points are necessarily novel; many are implicitly or explicitly present in other papers.)
 Attention heads can be understood as independent operations, each outputting a result which is added into the residual stream.√Ç Attention heads are often described in an alternate √¢¬Ä¬úconcatenate and multiply√¢¬Ä¬ù formulation for computational efficiency, but this is mathematically equivalent. Attention-only models can be written as a sum of interpretable end-to-end functions mapping tokens to changes in logits.√Ç These functions correspond to √¢¬Ä¬úpaths√¢¬Ä¬ù through the model, and are linear if one freezes the attention patterns. Transformers have an enormous amount of linear structure.√Ç One can learn a lot simply by breaking apart sums and multiplying together chains of matrices. Attention heads can be understood as having two largely independent computations: a QK (√¢¬Ä¬úquery-key√¢¬Ä¬ù) circuit which computes the attention pattern, and an OV (√¢¬Ä¬úoutput-value√¢¬Ä¬ù) circuit which computes how each token affects the output if attended to. Key, query, and value vectors can be thought of as intermediate results in the computation of the low-rank matrices W_Q^TW_K and W_OW_V. It can be useful to describe transformers without reference to them. Composition of attention heads greatly increases the expressivity of transformers. There are three different ways attention heads can compose, corresponding to keys, queries, and values. Key and query composition are very different from value composition. All components of a transformer (the token embedding, attention heads, MLP layers, and unembedding) communicate with each other by reading and writing to different subspaces of the residual stream. Rather than analyze the residual stream vectors, it can be helpful to decompose the residual stream into all these different communication channels, corresponding to paths through the model. 
 Transformer Overview
Before we attempt to reverse engineer transformers, it's helpful to briefly review the high-level structure of transformers and describe how we think about them.
In many cases, we've found it helpful to reframe transformers in equivalent, but non-standard ways. Mechanistic interpretability requires us to break models down into human-interpretable pieces. An important first step is finding the representation which makes it easiest to reason about the model. In modern deep learning, there is √¢¬Ä¬î√Ç for good reason! √¢¬Ä¬î√Ç a lot of emphasis on computational efficiency, and our mathematical descriptions of models often mirror decisions in how one would write efficient code to run the model. But when there are many equivalent ways to represent the same computation, it is likely that the most human-interpretable representation and the most computationally efficient representation will be different.
Reviewing transformers will also let us align on terminology, which can sometimes vary. We'll also introduce some notation in the process, but since this notation is used across many sections, we provide a detailed description of all notation in the notation appendix as a concise reference for readers.

you can change this to a shorter time or a longer time up to 1 hour,
by changing the task timeout setting as described in this page. There is no
explicit timeout on a job execution: when all tasks are done, the job execution
is done.
In the case of retries, the timeout setting applies to each attempt of a task.
If the task attempt does not complete within this time, it will be
stopped.
The units specify a duration; for example, 10m5s is ten minutes
and five seconds. If you don't specify a unit, seconds are assumed as the unit.
For example, the value 10 is 10 seconds.

1194,https://www.bbc.com/sport/formula1/articles/c4gqd8lz9g1o.amp,Aston Martin: Adrian Newey will join in ¬£30m-a-year deal - BBC Sport,"Image source, Getty Images    Image caption,  Adrian Newey is set to join Aston Martin in 2025        Author,  Andrew Benson     Role,  F1 Correspondent     7 September 2024, 12:45 BST     Leading Formula 1 designer Adrian Newey will join Aston Martin next year. An Aston Martin source told BBC Sport that Newey has made a long-term commitment to the team, said to be a five-year contract worth up to a possible ¬£30m a year, including bonuses and add-ons. The deal will be announced at a news conference organised by Aston Martin at their F1 base at Silverstone on Tuesday. Newey, who in April negotiated an early exit from his contract as Red Bull chief technical officer, will start work in early March. The 65-year-old's manager Eddie Jordan refused to discuss the situation when approached for comment by BBC Sport. An Aston Martin spokesperson said: ""Adrian has been linked to many teams and would be an asset to any team, but we don't have anything to announce."" Securing Newey is a coup for Aston Martin owner Lawrence Stroll after investing heavily in the team with the ambition of turning them into world championship contenders.         Stroll has funded a state-of-the-art new factory, including a wind tunnel, employed a series of top engineers and secured Honda as a works engine partner from 2026. The team also have two-time world champion Fernando Alonso under contract until the end of 2026. Newey has built a reputation as the greatest F1 designer in history after winning 12 drivers‚Äô championships and 13 constructors‚Äô titles in a career that spans the Williams, McLaren and Red Bull teams. In particular, he has a reputation for stealing a march on rivals at the beginning of a period of new regulations. The deal he negotiated to leave Red Bull, to whom he had been under contract until the end of 2025, frees him to join another team in time to have a significant impact on the design they produce for 2026. F1 rules forbid teams from starting design work on the aerodynamics of their 2026 before the start of next year. Newey will be the design lead for a team who have invested heavily in engineering talent in recent years. Former Mercedes engine chief Andy Cowell joins as chief executive officer on 1 October. Aston Martin have signed former Ferrari chassis technical director Enrico Cardile, who will start work in his role as chief technical officer at an unspecified point in 2025. Aston Martin's technical director is Dan Fallows, who joined in April 2022 after working as an aerodynamicist under Newey at Red Bull from 2006 until 2021."

1200,https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/soff,Soff: Automating manufacturing supply chains. | Y Combinator,"Supply chain operating system for manufacturing companies. Soff is a supply chain operating system for manufacturing companies. We unify supply chain data and automate core workflows, such as data entry, requesting quotes, comparing quotes, and issuing purchase orders. Our customers save dozens of hours a week spent on repetitive manual tasks.      Soff   Founded: 2024   Team Size: 2   Location: San Francisco        Active Founders      Berni Hausleitner Co-Founder at Soff         Raban von Spiegel Co-founder at Soff            Company Launches         üöõ Soff: Supply Chain Operating System for Manufacturing Companies      ‚õìÔ∏è TL;DR 
 Soff is a supply chain operating system for manufacturing companies. We automate data entry, requesting quotes, comparing quotes, and issuing purchase orders. Our customers save dozens of hours a week spent on repetitive manual tasks.
üë¨ Team 
We met five years ago while studying at the CDTM in Munich. Most recently, Berni worked as a full-stack engineer at Tesla on the Autopilot team, whilst Raban finished his engineering master‚Äôs at Stanford. At Tesla, Berni built tons of internal tooling and saw the supply chain inefficiencies firsthand. During the batch, Raban worked as a purchasing manager for one of our customers.
üåã Problem 
Supply chain data is spread across multiple platforms, such as ERPs, custom spreadsheets, and email inboxes, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of visibility. Supply Chain Managers spend hours each week searching through emails and spreadsheets to track the status of parts procurement, from request to quote to award. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and delays. For example, changes in production schedules require Supply Chain Managers to follow up with all suppliers individually to adjust their purchase orders. Quotes that aren‚Äôt used are lost in the abyss of email inboxes. Suppliers are reluctant to upload quotes to yet another portal and often fail to notify about delays, leading to costly production standstills.
üöõ Solution 
 
Soff connects suppliers, parts, and quotes into a single platform.
We integrate with ERPs and email to automate supplier communication, send RFQs, and issue purchase orders. We turn unstructured email and PDFs into SQL-ready data, injecting quotes directly into the ERP system. We eliminate the need for manual data entry and dedicated supplier portals, thus increasing supplier response rates.
Our platform stores quote data, ensuring no loss of information when switching suppliers or moving from single-source to dual-source. It also tracks parts from the initial request through to the final receipt, providing a complete overview for supplier management.
Soff enables manufacturers to deliver higher-quality products faster. Companies like SpaceX (Warpdrive), Rivian (Basecamp), and Apple (Incline) spend millions on building their in-house supply chain tools‚Äîwe bring that level of efficiency to any manufacturer.

He asked how we could really be serious and get work done while wearing a fleece and sneakers. I told him we worked long and hard, and therefore had to be as comfortable as possible: Didn‚Äôt he find wearing a suit a distraction?  Culture ranges from how people dress and talk to leadership and reward structures. We all know that culture fit matters‚Äîyou‚Äôll be happier and more successful (as will your supervisor) if there‚Äôs a good match.  Thankfully, there are specific interview questions you can ask to find out whether a company is right for you that will give you much more information than the standard, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your culture like?‚Äù Of course, you won‚Äôt use all of the questions below with every interviewer, so pick the ones that are most important to you. If you‚Äôre deciding between multiple offers, ask the same questions across organizations so you can compare responses. Figure Out How the Company Engages and Supports Employees With these questions, your goal is to see how engaged employees are and whether they feel like they have a good ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with their employer. That includes growth opportunities and support‚Äîeven when projects don‚Äôt meet desired outcomes.  Companies who really live their values integrate them into their talent management processes. You‚Äôll see those values showing up in everyday behaviors and important decisions, not just displayed on the walls and coffee mugs.  Here are five questions you can ask to get a better sense of company values and employee engagement:   What makes you proud to work at this company? How does the organization support your professional development and career growth? Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail? What role do company values play in hiring and performance reviews? What‚Äôs one thing you would change about the company if you could?  Figure Out How the Company Deals With Conflict and Politics Conflict is everywhere‚Äîand that can be a good thing! Healthy conflict allows employees to share and resolve multiple viewpoints. When people consistently avoid conflict, differences fester and may lead to resentment. On the other hand, high-performing teams have a productive approach to disagreement and problem solving, so that everyone feels heard.  Additionally, strong leaders are open to innovation. The best managers share real time feedback‚Äîbe it positive or constructive. A lack of two-way feedback may be a sign of conflict avoidance.  Here are five questions you can ask to gain a clearer understanding of conflict and politics at a given company:  What causes conflict, and how is conflict resolved? How would you describe ‚Äúorganizational politics‚Äù at the company? How are decisions made when there‚Äôs disagreement and stakes are high? When and how do people like to give and receive feedback? Titles aside, who in the organization has the power to gets things done?  Figure Out What the Day-to-Day Work Environment is Like Naturally, you want to join a company that recognizes people‚Äôs achievements, celebrates success, and cares about its employees and the community.  And if you‚Äôre hoping to work remotely or find a job that fits your schedule, you should definitely probe the organization‚Äôs flexibility during the interview process. Choose a place where people have fun, feel valued, and where the environment fits your needs. Here are five questions you can ask to gain more insight into the work environment:  What are some of the ways the company celebrates success? How do you as a manager‚Äîor, if more appropriate, how does your manager‚Äîsupport and motivate your team?  What kind of flexible work arrangements do people have? Do you have a matching gifts program or sponsor local volunteer events? If you have a specific need, ask about it. For example, ‚ÄúI take my kids to school on Wednesdays, is it OK if I come in late once a week?‚Äù (Note: Save a question like this for a final interview. If it‚Äôs the very first question you ask‚Äîbefore questions like these‚Äîit could count against you.)   Remember, every company has a unique value system, approach to conflicts and internal politics, and working environment. If someone tells you otherwise, be suspicious! While the only way to know what a company is really like is to experience it first hand, investing time upfront and learning as much as you can will help minimize surprises.

When you're interviewing for a job, you have a chance to see if the company is the right fit for you. Toward the end of your interview, the hiring manager is likely to ask if you have any questions for them. Use this as your opportunity to learn more about their company culture. In this article, we share a list of company culture questions that will help you determine if a particular job aligns with your company culture preferences. Related: How To Prepare for Company Culture Interview Questions  Why it's important to ask about company culture Having company culture questions to ask during your interview is an important part of determining if a company is the right fit for you. While an interview is your chance to impress an employer, it is also an opportunity to gauge if you would be happy working for them. By asking the right questions, you can tell if this would be an environment that aligns with your working style and personality. For instance, if you are an extroverted person, you may want a company with an open and social culture. Related: How To Create a Company Culture: Examples and Tips  15 company culture questions to ask during an interview Here are some company culture questions to ask during your next interview: What is the best part of working here? This question can help you determine why people choose to stay with the company. If your interviewer can easily list a few perks of working for the company, this can be a good sign. If they hesitate to come up with a good answer, you may want to inquire further about the answer they provide. Their response can help you gauge if you will enjoy working here. How does the company support professional development? If you are someone who wants to move forward in your career, then it is important to inquire about professional development and career growth opportunities. Finding an employer who sponsors things like continuing education, learning seminars and additional training can indicate that they want their employees to excel in their roles. What challenges is the company experiencing? While this question could go beyond company culture, it can help you see if the company has any internal issues. For instance, if they are rapidly expanding, this could lead to a fast-paced company culture. Asking this question can help you decide if you can handle any challenges the company is currently working through. What is your process for giving feedback? Getting feedback is a part of growing as a professional. This question can give you some insight into the company's feedback process. While some companies have extensive performance reviews, others might be more laissez-faire about giving employees feedback. If you are someone who needs a lot of structure and support with goal-setting, you want the employer to have a fully set up feedback system in place. Is this a collaborative work environment? This question helps you learn if you will be working mostly independently or in a team setting. This is a great company culture question to ask because this will directly impact your work style. If you are someone who works better alone, you might hope for an answer that indicates that the company respects personal boundaries. If you enjoy group work, look for an answer that indicates that you will regularly work with others. What kind of team-building activities do you organize? An employer who values an open and communicative company culture will likely encourage employees to engage in team-building activities. By participating in fun games, challenges and events, employees can get to know each other better. Asking this question can help you determine if you would be comfortable participating in the team-building activities the company provides. What kind of personality types tend to do well here? This question can help you determine if you have the right personality for this job. An employer typically has an idea of what kind of person will be successful at their company. Use this question to see what your strengths would be in this workplace and what areas you could improve. Can you explain your management style? Oftentimes, the manager of the job you're applying for is your interviewer. Asking them this question can help you tell if their management style aligns with your own working style. For instance, when just getting into your field, you may want a manager who is hands-on and supportive. Likewise, if you are highly skilled at your job, you may prefer a manager who is more laid back. What are the main values of this company? You can learn a lot about a company's culture by getting to know its core values. If your interviewer can easily list them off, this is a good sign that the company's values are a central part of the work you will be doing. You could even go a little further and ask how they reflect these values in the work that they do. Related: 5 Types of Work Environments (and How To Identify Which Is Right for You)  What does work-life balance mean to you? Asking this question can help you determine if the interviewer's definition of a healthy work-life balance aligns with your own. If you are someone who needs clear barriers between your work life and personal life, look for some clear indicators in their answer. For instance, ""We encourage employees to turn off their notifications outside of working hours."" or ""Our paid-time-off policy ensures employees get enough personal time throughout the year."" are both answers that show they value a work-life balance. How do you acknowledge employee success? An indicator of a positive work environment is when an employer celebrates their employees' achievements. Getting recognition for your hard work is a good feeling. By creating a culture of praise and acknowledgment, companies can boost employee morale and improve retention rates. Asking this question helps you figure out how an employer might reward you for doing well at your job. How do you get new employees onboarded? The onboarding process can be the most important part of setting an employee up for success. When an employer has an extensive onboarding process that involves helping new hires feel welcome, this may be an indicator of a positive company culture. This question can help you learn what to expect during your first few weeks of work if you were to get the job. What does your team do to address employees' failures? A quality employer understands that people can make mistakes or fail to reach their goals. Asking this question can help you figure out what strategies this employer uses to help employees learn from their downfalls. Look for an answer where they explain the process for overcoming shortcomings. Use their response to decide if they are willing to uplift employees and help them reach their goals. Does this company do anything to give back? If you are someone who values volunteerism and charity support, asking this question can help you learn if your company values giving back to those in need. See if the interviewer is willing to discuss what organizations or causes the company supports. Some companies even give employees the opportunity to take time off to volunteer. Related: All About Cultural Competence and Workplace Culture  What is the dress code here? While you may be able to tell what the dress code is just by looking around, this question can help you learn what you need to wear on a daily basis. While some people don't mind having to dress up every day, others prefer a more casual and comfortable look. Although this may not be your determining factor when accepting a job offer, it is definitely something you can be aware of. Related: The 5 Most Common Types of Corporate Culture  Tips for asking about company culture Follow these tips when figuring out which company culture questions to ask during your interview:   Do some research. Before your interview, do some digging to find out as much about the company's culture as possible. See what kind of social media presence they have and whether they include anything relevant on their website. Use what you find to inform your questions and guide your conversation.    Ask employees questions. If you get the chance to meet with any employees of the company, make a point to ask them some questions about the company's culture. They may be able to give you more authentic answers since you may potentially become one of them.    Reflect on your own preferences. When coming up with a list of questions, determine what's important to you. If you need a social work environment, come up with questions that can help you learn if a company is open and collaborative. If you need flexibility and freedom, ask about their schedule expectations. Make sure your question"

For example, Codeium might produce the following implementation for rotating a point counterclockwise around an origin by a given angle:   Great! This would work, but maybe you don't like the fact that there are duplicate calls to slower trigonometric functions on the same angle inputs. If you hover over the text insertion point (the start of the Codeium suggestion), you will see options to toggle through options via Next and Previous alongside the standard accept option:    Tip: Just like Tab is the keyboard shortcut for accepting a suggestion, you can use ‚å• + ] and ‚å• + [ (on MacOSX) or Alt + ] and Alt + [ (on Windows / Linux) for Next and Previous respectively.  In this example, looking at the next option gives a completion where the trigonometric functions are computed only once:    Note: if these options are grayed out (or the shortcuts are not changing the suggestion), this is because Codeium believes there is only one high probability option or all top options are similar enough that they can be combined into a single option."

1262,https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/locators/,Locator strategies | Selenium,"Ways to identify one or more specific elements in the DOM. A locator is a way to identify elements on a page. It is the argument passed to the
Finding element methods. Check out our encouraged test practices for tips on
locators, including which to use when and
why to declare locators separately from the finding methods. Traditional Locators Selenium provides support for these 8 traditional location strategies in WebDriver:    Locator Description     class name Locates elements whose class name contains the search value (compound class names are not permitted)   css selector Locates elements matching a CSS selector   id Locates elements whose ID attribute matches the search value   name Locates elements whose NAME attribute matches the search value   link text Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value   partial link text Locates anchor elements whose visible text contains the search value. If multiple elements are matching, only the first one will be selected.   tag name Locates elements whose tag name matches the search value   xpath Locates elements matching an XPath expression    Relative Locators  Selenium 4 introduces Relative Locators (previously
called as Friendly Locators). These locators are helpful when it is not easy to construct a locator for
the desired element, but easy to describe spatially where the element is in relation to an element that does have
an easily constructed locator. How it works Selenium uses the JavaScript function
getBoundingClientRect()
to determine the size and position of elements on the page, and can use this information to locate neighboring elements.find the relative elements. Relative locator methods can take as the argument for the point of origin, either a previously located element reference,
or another locator. In these examples we‚Äôll be using locators only, but you could swap the locator in the final method with
an element object and it will work the same. Let us consider the below example for understanding the relative locators.   Available relative locators Above If the email text field element is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the password text field element is,
we can locate the text field element using the fact that it is an ‚Äúinput‚Äù element ‚Äúabove‚Äù the password element.   Java   Python   CSharp   Ruby   JavaScript   Kotlin      By emailLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""input"")).above(By.id(""password""));     email_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, ""input"").above({By.ID: ""password""})     var emailLocator = RelativeBy.WithLocator(By.TagName(""input"")).Above(By.Id(""password""));     email_locator = {relative: {tag_name: 'input', above: {id: 'password'}}}     let emailLocator = locateWith(By.tagName('input')).above(By.id('password'));     val emailLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""input"")).above(By.id(""password""))    Below If the password text field element is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the email text field element is,
we can locate the text field element using the fact that it is an ‚Äúinput‚Äù element ‚Äúbelow‚Äù the email element.   Java   Python   CSharp   Ruby   JavaScript   Kotlin      By passwordLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""input"")).below(By.id(""email""));     password_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, ""input"").below({By.ID: ""email""})     var passwordLocator = RelativeBy.WithLocator(By.TagName(""input"")).Below(By.Id(""email""));     password_locator = {relative: {tag_name: 'input', below: {id: 'email'}}}     let passwordLocator = locateWith(By.tagName('input')).below(By.id('email'));     val passwordLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""input"")).below(By.id(""email""))    Left of If the cancel button is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the submit button element is,
we can locate the cancel button element using the fact that it is a ‚Äúbutton‚Äù element to the ‚Äúleft of‚Äù the submit element.   Java   Python   CSharp   Ruby   JavaScript   Kotlin      By cancelLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""button"")).toLeftOf(By.id(""submit""));     cancel_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, ""button"").to_left_of({By.ID: ""submit""})     var cancelLocator = RelativeBy.WithLocator(By.tagName(""button"")).LeftOf(By.Id(""submit""));     cancel_locator = {relative: {tag_name: 'button', left: {id: 'submit'}}}     let cancelLocator = locateWith(By.tagName('button')).toLeftOf(By.id('submit'));     val cancelLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""button"")).toLeftOf(By.id(""submit""))    Right of If the submit button is not easily identifiable for some reason, but the cancel button element is,
we can locate the submit button element using the fact that it is a ‚Äúbutton‚Äù element ‚Äúto the right of‚Äù the cancel element.   Java   Python   CSharp   Ruby   JavaScript   Kotlin      By submitLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""button"")).toRightOf(By.id(""cancel""));     submit_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, ""button"").to_right_of({By.ID: ""cancel""})     var submitLocator = RelativeBy.WithLocator(By.tagName(""button"")).RightOf(By.Id(""cancel""));     submit_locator = {relative: {tag_name: 'button', right: {id: 'cancel'}}}     let submitLocator = locateWith(By.tagName('button')).toRightOf(By.id('cancel'));     val submitLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""button"")).toRightOf(By.id(""cancel""))    Near If the relative positioning is not obvious, or it varies based on window size, you can use the near method to
identify an element that is at most 50px away from the provided locator.
One great use case for this is to work with a form element that doesn‚Äôt have an easily constructed locator,
but its associated input label element does.   Java   Python   CSharp   Ruby   JavaScript   Kotlin      By emailLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""input"")).near(By.id(""lbl-email""));     email_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, ""input"").near({By.ID: ""lbl-email""})     var emailLocator = RelativeBy.WithLocator(By.tagName(""input"")).Near(By.Id(""lbl-email""));     email_locator = {relative: {tag_name: 'input', near: {id: 'lbl-email'}}}     let emailLocator = locateWith(By.tagName('input')).near(By.id('lbl-email'));     val emailLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""input"")).near(By.id(""lbl-email""));    Chaining relative locators You can also chain locators if needed. Sometimes the element is most easily identified as being both above/below one element and right/left of another.   Java   Python   CSharp   Ruby   JavaScript   Kotlin      By submitLocator = RelativeLocator.with(By.tagName(""button"")).below(By.id(""email"")).toRightOf(By.id(""cancel""));     submit_locator = locate_with(By.TAG_NAME, ""button"").below({By.ID: ""email""}).to_right_of({By.ID: ""cancel""})     var submitLocator = RelativeBy.WithLocator(By.tagName(""button"")).Below(By.Id(""email"")).RightOf(By.Id(""cancel""));     submit_locator = {relative: {tag_name: 'button', below: {id: 'email'}, right: {id: 'cancel'}}}     let submitLocator = locateWith(By.tagName('button'))."

This function is very useful but can be better.
components.append(xpath_tag if xpath_index == 1 else '%s[%d]' % (xpath_tag, xpath_index))
This line chose to leave out index [1], but in practice, not all the indices 1 can be left out. If you want to select one element only, doing so might result in selecting multiple elements instead of one.

Good point, I was relying on BeautifulSoup objects identity (which is probably __hash__ ) which looks like cannot be trusted in your case, so I updated the snippet (unfortunately, with a 3% performance hit on my tests).

This script relies purely on DOM tree node location, so no need for other filtering.
If your DOM tree is subject to a lot of changes, this script (and probably any automated script) will not suit your case.

1265,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11465555/can-we-use-xpath-with-beautifulsoup,python - can we use XPath with BeautifulSoup? - Stack Overflow,"Nope, BeautifulSoup, by itself, does not support XPath expressions.
An alternative library, lxml, does support XPath 1.0. It has a BeautifulSoup compatible mode where it'll try and parse broken HTML the way Soup does. However, the default lxml HTML parser does just as good a job of parsing broken HTML, and I believe is faster.
Once you've parsed your document into an lxml tree, you can use the .xpath() method to search for elements.
 try:
# Python 2
from urllib2 import urlopen
except ImportError:
from urllib.request import urlopen
from lxml import etree
url = ""http://www.example.com/servlet/av/ResultTemplate=AVResult.html""
response = urlopen(url)
htmlparser = etree.HTMLParser()
tree = etree.parse(response, htmlparser)
tree.xpath(xpathselector)
 
There is also a dedicated lxml.html() module with additional functionality.
Note that in the above example I passed the response object directly to lxml, as having the parser read directly from the stream is more efficient than reading the response into a large string first. To do the same with the requests library, you want to set stream=True and pass in the response.raw object after enabling transparent transport decompression:
 import lxml.html
import requests
url = ""http://www.example.com/servlet/av/ResultTemplate=AVResult.html""
response = requests.get(url, stream=True)
response.raw.decode_content = True
tree = lxml.html.parse(response.raw)
 
Of possible interest to you is the CSS Selector support; the CSSSelector class translates CSS statements into XPath expressions, making your search for td.empformbody that much easier:
 from lxml.cssselect import CSSSelector
td_empformbody = CSSSelector('td.empformbody')
for elem in td_empformbody(tree):
# Do something with these table cells.
 
Coming full circle: BeautifulSoup itself does have very complete CSS selector support:
 for cell in soup.select('table#foobar td.empformbody'):
# Do something with these table cells.

can we use XPath with BeautifulSoup?
Ask Question

I am using BeautifulSoup to scrape an URL and I had the following code, to find the td tag whose class is 'empformbody':
import urllib
import urllib2
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup
url = ""http://www.example.com/servlet/av/ResultTemplate=AVResult.html""
req = urllib2.Request(url)
response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
the_page = response.read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(the_page)
soup.findAll('td',attrs={'class':'empformbody'})
Now in the above code we can use findAll to get tags and information related to them, but I want to use XPath. Is it possible to use XPath with BeautifulSoup? If possible, please provide me example code.

* web-scraping
* xpath
* beautifulsoup

As others have said, BeautifulSoup doesn't have xpath support. There are probably a number of ways to get something from an xpath, including using Selenium. However, here's a solution that works in either Python 2 or 3:
from lxml import html
import requests
page = requests.get('http://econpy.pythonanywhere.com/ex/001.html')
tree = html.fromstring(page.content)
#This will create a list of buyers:
buyers = tree.xpath('//div[@title=""buyer-name""]/text()')
#This will create a list of prices
prices = tree.xpath('//span[@class=""item-price""]/text()')
print('Buyers: ', buyers)
print('Prices: ', prices)
I used this as a reference.

I had a case where I was entering text into a field after which the text would be removed automatically. Turned out it was due to some site functionality where you had to
press the enter key after entering the text into the field. So, after sending your barcode text with sendKeys method, send 'enter' directly after it. Note that you will have to import the selenium Keys class. See my code below.

Use this code.
 driver.FindElement(By.XPath("".//[@id='header']/div/div[3]/div/form/input[1]"")).SendKeys(""25025"");

It might be the JavaScript check for some valid condition.
Two things you can perform a/c to your requirements: 
either check for the valid string-input in the text-box. 
or set a loop against that text box to enter the value until you post the form/request.
 String barcode=""0000000047166"";
WebElement strLocator = driver.findElement(By.xpath(""//*[@id='div-barcode']""));
strLocator.sendKeys(barcode);

1274,https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/locating-elements.html,4. Locating Elements ‚Äî Selenium Python Bindings 2 documentation,"There are various strategies to locate elements in a page. You can use the most
appropriate one for your case. Selenium provides the following method to
locate elements in a page:
 find_element 
 To find multiple elements (these methods will return a list): 
 find_elements 
Example usage:
 from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//button[text()=""Some text""]')
driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, '//button')
 
The attributes available for the By class are used to locate elements on a page.
These are the attributes available for By class:
 ID = ""id""
NAME = ""name""
XPATH = ""xpath""
LINK_TEXT = ""link text""
PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT = ""partial link text""
TAG_NAME = ""tag name""
CLASS_NAME = ""class name""
CSS_SELECTOR = ""css selector""
 
The √¢¬Ä¬òBy√¢¬Ä¬ô class is used to specify which attribute is used to locate elements on a page.
These are the various ways the attributes are used to locate elements on a page:
 find_element(By.ID, ""id"")
find_element(By.NAME, ""name"")
find_element(By.XPATH, ""xpath"")
find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, ""link text"")
find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, ""partial link text"")
find_element(By.TAG_NAME, ""tag name"")
find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, ""class name"")
find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ""css selector"")
 
If you want to locate several elements with the same attribute replace find_element with find_elements.
4.1. Locating by Id√Ç¬∂ 
Use this when you know the id attribute of an element. With this strategy,
the first element with a matching id attribute will be returned. If no
element has a matching id attribute, a NoSuchElementException will be
raised.
For instance, consider this page source:
 &lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form id=""loginForm""&gt;
&lt;input name=""username"" type=""text"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""password"" type=""password"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""continue"" type=""submit"" value=""Login"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
 
The form element can be located like this:
 login_form = driver.find_element(By.ID, 'loginForm')
 
4.2. Locating by Name√Ç¬∂ 
Use this when you know the name attribute of an element. With this strategy,
the first element with a matching name attribute will be returned. If no
element has a matching name attribute, a NoSuchElementException will be
raised.
For instance, consider this page source:
 &lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form id=""loginForm""&gt;
&lt;input name=""username"" type=""text"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""password"" type=""password"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""continue"" type=""submit"" value=""Login"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""continue"" type=""button"" value=""Clear"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
 
The username &amp; password elements can be located like this:
 username = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'username')
password = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'password')
 
This will give the √¢¬Ä¬úLogin√¢¬Ä¬ù button as it occurs before the √¢¬Ä¬úClear√¢¬Ä¬ù button:
 continue = driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'continue')
 
4.3. Locating by XPath√Ç¬∂ 
XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML can
be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium users can leverage this powerful
language to target elements in their web applications. XPath supports the
simple methods of locating by id or name attributes and extends them by opening
up all sorts of new possibilities such as locating the third checkbox on the
page.
One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don√¢¬Ä¬ôt have a suitable id or
name attribute for the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to either
locate the element in absolute terms (not advised), or relative to an element
that does have an id or name attribute. XPath locators can also be used to
specify elements via attributes other than id and name.
Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html) and as
a result are likely to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the
application. By finding a nearby element with an id or name attribute (ideally
a parent element) you can locate your target element based on the relationship.
This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more robust.
For instance, consider this page source:
 &lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;form id=""loginForm""&gt;
&lt;input name=""username"" type=""text"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""password"" type=""password"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""continue"" type=""submit"" value=""Login"" /&gt;
&lt;input name=""continue"" type=""button"" value=""Clear"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
 
The form elements can be located like this:
 login_form = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""/html/body/form[1]"")
login_form = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//form[1]"")
login_form = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//form[@id='loginForm']"")
 
Absolute path (would break if the HTML was changed only slightly)
First form element in the HTML
The form element with attribute id set to loginForm 
The username element can be located like this:
 username = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//form[input/@name='username']"")
username = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//form[@id='loginForm']/input[1]"")
username = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//input[@name='username']"")
 
First form element with an input child element with name set to username 
First input child element of the form element with attribute id set to
loginForm 
First input element with attribute name set to username 
The √¢¬Ä¬úClear√¢¬Ä¬ù button element can be located like this:
 clear_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//input[@name='continue'][@type='button']"")
clear_button = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, ""//form[@id='loginForm']/input[4]"")
 
Input with attribute name set to continue and attribute type set to
button 
Fourth input child element of the form element with attribute id set to
loginForm 
These examples cover some basics, but in order to learn more, the following
references are recommended:
 W3Schools XPath Tutorial 
 W3C XPath Recommendation 
 XPath Tutorial
- with interactive examples.
Here is a couple of very useful Add-ons that can assist in discovering the XPath
of an element:
 xPath Finder -
Plugin to get the elements xPath.
 XPath Helper -
for Google Chrome
4.4. Locating Hyperlinks by Link Text√Ç¬∂ 
Use this when you know the link text used within an anchor tag. With this
strategy, the first element with the link text matching the provided value will
be returned. If no element has a matching link text attribute, a
NoSuchElementException will be raised.
For instance, consider this page source:
 &lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you sure you want to do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=""continue.html""&gt;Continue&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=""cancel.html""&gt;Cancel&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
 
The continue.html link can be located like this:
 continue_link = driver.find_element(By.LINK_TEXT, 'Continue')
continue_link = driver.find_element(By.PARTIAL_LINK_TEXT, 'Conti')
 
4.5. Locating Elements by Tag Name√Ç¬∂ 
Use this when you want to locate an element by tag name. With this strategy,
the first element with the given tag name will be returned. If no element has a
matching tag name, a NoSuchElementException will be raised.
For instance, consider this page source:
 &lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site content goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
 
The heading (h1) element can be located like this:
 heading1 = driver.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, 'h1')
 
4.6. Locating Elements by Class Name√Ç¬∂ 
Use this when you want to locate an element by class name. With this strategy,
the first element with the matching class name attribute will be returned. If
no element has a matching class name attribute, a NoSuchElementException
will be raised.
For instance, consider this page source:
 &lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p class=""content""&gt;Site content goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
 
The √¢¬Ä¬úp√¢¬Ä¬ù element can be located like this:
 content = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, 'content')

1286,https://playwright.dev/,Fast and reliable end-to-end testing for modern web apps | Playwright,"Any browser ‚Ä¢ Any platform ‚Ä¢ One API  Cross-browser. Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox.  Cross-platform. Test on Windows, Linux, and macOS, locally or on CI, headless or headed.  Cross-language. Use the Playwright API in TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, .NET, Java.  Test Mobile Web. Native mobile emulation of Google Chrome for Android and Mobile Safari. The same rendering engine works on your Desktop and in the Cloud.   Resilient ‚Ä¢ No flaky tests  Auto-wait. Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - the primary cause of flaky tests.  Web-first assertions. Playwright assertions are created specifically for the dynamic web. Checks are automatically retried until the necessary conditions are met.  Tracing. Configure test retry strategy, capture execution trace, videos, screenshots to eliminate flakes.   No trade-offs ‚Ä¢ No limits Browsers run web content belonging to different origins in different processes. Playwright is aligned with the modern browsers architecture and runs tests out-of-process. This makes Playwright free of the typical in-process test runner limitations.  Multiple everything. Test scenarios that span multiple tabs, multiple origins and multiple users. Create scenarios with different contexts for different users and run them against your server, all in one test.  Trusted events. Hover elements, interact with dynamic controls, produce trusted events. Playwright uses real browser input pipeline indistinguishable from the real user.  Test frames, pierce Shadow DOM. Playwright selectors pierce shadow DOM and allow entering frames seamlessly.   Full isolation ‚Ä¢ Fast execution  Browser contexts. Playwright creates a browser context for each test. Browser context is equivalent to a brand new browser profile. This delivers full test isolation with zero overhead. Creating a new browser context only takes a handful of milliseconds.  Log in once. Save the authentication state of the context and reuse it in all the tests. This bypasses repetitive log-in operations in each test, yet delivers full isolation of independent tests.   Powerful Tooling  Codegen. Generate tests by recording your actions. Save them into any language.  Playwright inspector. Inspect page, generate selectors, step through the test execution, see click points, explore execution logs.  Trace Viewer. Capture all the information to investigate the test failure. Playwright trace contains test execution screencast, live DOM snapshots, action explorer, test source, and many more."

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.
Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.
 Example 1: 
 Input: asteroids = [5,10,-5]
Output: [5,10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
 Example 2: 
 Input: asteroids = [8,-8]
Output: []
Explanation: The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.
 Example 3: 
 Input: asteroids = [10,2,-5]
Output: [10]
Explanation: The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.
 Constraints: 
 2 &lt;= asteroids.length &lt;= 104

Learn how to use vision capabilities to understand images.
     Introduction   
GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, and GPT-4 Turbo have vision capabilities, meaning the models can take in images and answer questions about them. Historically, language model systems have been limited by taking in a single input modality, text.
     Quickstart   
Images are made available to the model in two main ways: by passing a link to the image or by passing the base64 encoded image directly in the request. Images can be passed in the user messages.

The model is best at answering general questions about what is present in the images. While it does understand the relationship between objects in images, it is not yet optimized to answer detailed questions about the location of certain objects in an image. For example, you can ask it what color a car is or what some ideas for dinner might be based on what is in you fridge, but if you show it an image of a room and ask it where the chair is, it may not answer the question correctly.
It is important to keep in mind the limitations of the model as you explore what use-cases visual understanding can be applied to.

     Uploading base 64 encoded images   
If you have an image or set of images locally, you can pass those to the model in base 64 encoded format, here is an example of this in action:

     Multiple image inputs   
The Chat Completions API is capable of taking in and processing multiple image inputs in both base64 encoded format or as an image URL. The model will process each image and use the information from all of them to answer the question.

Here the model is shown two copies of the same image and can answer questions about both or each of the images independently.
     Low or high fidelity image understanding   
By controlling the detail parameter, which has three options, low, high, or auto, you have control over how the model processes the image and generates its textual understanding. By default, the model will use the auto setting which will look at the image input size and decide if it should use the low or high setting.
 low will enable the ""low res"" mode. The model will receive a low-res 512px x 512px version of the image, and represent the image with a budget of 85 tokens. This allows the API to return faster responses and consume fewer input tokens for use cases that do not require high detail.
 high will enable ""high res"" mode, which first allows the model to first see the low res image (using 85 tokens) and then creates detailed crops using 170 tokens for each 512px x 512px tile.

     Managing images   
The Chat Completions API, unlike the Assistants API, is not stateful. That means you have to manage the messages (including images) you pass to the model yourself. If you want to pass the same image to the model multiple times, you will have to pass the image each time you make a request to the API.
For long running conversations, we suggest passing images via URL's instead of base64. The latency of the model can also be improved by downsizing your images ahead of time to be less than the maximum size they are expected them to be. For low res mode, we expect a 512px x 512px image. For high res mode, the short side of the image should be less than 768px and the long side should be less than 2,000px.
After an image has been processed by the model, it is deleted from OpenAI servers and not retained. We do not use data uploaded via the OpenAI API to train our models.
     Limitations   
While GPT-4 with vision is powerful and can be used in many situations, it is important to understand the limitations of the model. Here are some of the limitations we are aware of:
Medical images: The model is not suitable for interpreting specialized medical images like CT scans and shouldn't be used for medical advice.
Non-English: The model may not perform optimally when handling images with text of non-Latin alphabets, such as Japanese or Korean.
Small text: Enlarge text within the image to improve readability, but avoid cropping important details.
Rotation: The model may misinterpret rotated / upside-down text or images.
Visual elements: The model may struggle to understand graphs or text where colors or styles like solid, dashed, or dotted lines vary.
Spatial reasoning: The model struggles with tasks requiring precise spatial localization, such as identifying chess positions.
Accuracy: The model may generate incorrect descriptions or captions in certain scenarios.
Image shape: The model struggles with panoramic and fisheye images.
Metadata and resizing: The model doesn't process original file names or metadata, and images are resized before analysis, affecting their original dimensions.
Counting: May give approximate counts for objects in images.
CAPTCHAS: For safety reasons, we have implemented a system to block the submission of CAPTCHAs.
     Calculating costs   
Image inputs are metered and charged in tokens, just as text inputs are. The token cost of a given image is determined by two factors: its size, and the detail option on each image_url block. All images with detail: low cost 85 tokens each. detail: high images are first scaled to fit within a 2048 x 2048 square, maintaining their aspect ratio. Then, they are scaled such that the shortest side of the image is 768px long. Finally, we count how many 512px squares the image consists of. Each of those squares costs 170 tokens. Another 85 tokens are always added to the final total.
Here are some examples demonstrating the above.
A 1024 x 1024 square image in detail: high mode costs 765 tokens
1024 is less than 2048, so there is no initial resize.
The shortest side is 1024, so we scale the image down to 768 x 768.
4 512px square tiles are needed to represent the image, so the final token cost is 170 * 4 + 85 = 765.
A 2048 x 4096 image in detail: high mode costs 1105 tokens
We scale down the image to 1024 x 2048 to fit within the 2048 square.
The shortest side is 1024, so we further scale down to 768 x 1536.
6 512px tiles are needed, so the final token cost is 170 * 6 + 85 = 1105.
A 4096 x 8192 image in detail: low most costs 85 tokens
Regardless of input size, low detail images are a fixed cost.
     FAQ   
     Can I fine-tune the image capabilities in gpt-4?   
No, we do not support fine-tuning the image capabilities of gpt-4 at this time.
     Can I use gpt-4 to generate images?   
No, you can use dall-e-3 to generate images and gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4-turbo to understand images.
     What type of files can I upload?   
We currently support PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpeg and .jpg), WEBP (.webp), and non-animated GIF (.gif).
     Is there a limit to the size of the image I can upload?   
Yes, we restrict image uploads to 20MB per image.
     Can I delete an image I uploaded?   
No, we will delete the image for you automatically after it has been processed by the model.
     Where can I learn more about the considerations of GPT-4 with Vision?   
You can find details about our evaluations, preparation, and mitigation work in the GPT-4 with Vision system card.
We have further implemented a system to block the submission of CAPTCHAs.
     How do rate limits for GPT-4 with Vision work?   
We process images at the token level, so each image we process counts towards your tokens per minute (TPM) limit. See the calculating costs section for details on the formula used to determine token count per image.
     Can GPT-4 with Vision understand image metadata?   
No, the model does not receive image metadata.
     What happens if my image is unclear?   
If an image is ambiguous or unclear, the model will do its best to interpret it. However, the results may be less accurate. A good rule of thumb is that if an average human cannot see the info in an image at the resolutions used in low/high res mode, then the model cannot either."

Approaches
(Also explained in the code)
 Frequency Counting: 
Two vectors (freq1 and freq2) are used to count the frequency of each letter in word1 and word2.
 freq1[i] stores the count of the i-th letter in the English alphabet in word1, and similarly for freq2.
 Checking Presence of Characters: 
Iterate over each character in the alphabet.
If a character is present in one word and not in the other (or vice versa), return false.
This ensures that both words contain the same set of characters.
 Sorting Frequencies: 
Sort the frequency vectors (freq1 and freq2).
This step is necessary because the order of frequencies doesn't matter, only their values.
 Comparing Sorted Frequencies: 
Iterate through the sorted frequency vectors and compare corresponding elements.
If any corresponding elements are not equal, return false.
 Final Result: 
If all the checks pass, return true, indicating that the two words are ""close"" as per the problem definition.
Complexity
Time complexity:
    
(Sorting on a constant Array (n=26) does not affect the time complexity of the algorithm) 
Space complexity:
    
Code
    class   Solution   { 
     public : 
     bool   closeStrings ( std :: string word1 ,  std :: string word2 )   { 
    std :: vector &lt; int &gt;   freq1 ( 26 ,   0 ) ;

     } 
  
    for   ( char  ch  :  word2 )   { 
    freq2 [ ch  -   'a' ] ++ ; 
     } 
  
    for   ( int  i  =   0 ;  i  &lt;   26 ;  i ++ )   {

     return   false ; 
     } 
     }

Determine if Two Strings Are Close - LeetCode
2024-01-14T00:00:00Z
    Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:
Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -&gt; aecdb  
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example,  aacabb -&gt; bbcbaa  (all a&#39;s turn into b&#39;s, and all b&#39;s turn into a&#39;s)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Determine if Two Strings Are Close - LeetCode
2024-01-14T00:00:00Z
    Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:
Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -&gt; aecdb  
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example,  aacabb -&gt; bbcbaa  (all a&#39;s turn into b&#39;s, and all b&#39;s turn into a&#39;s)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.
Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true  if  word1  and  word2  are close, and  false  otherwise. 
 Example 1: 
 Input: word1 = &#34;abc&#34;, word2 = &#34;bca&#34;
Output: true

Footnote ‚Ä† For international wire transfers, other fees may apply in lieu of our standard wire transfer fee. These fees include, but are not limited to, those charged by the recipient's financial institution, foreign taxes, currency conversion, and other fees that may be a part of the wire transfer process. Any additional fees are determined and disclosed at the time the transaction is entered.
 
When deciding between sending in foreign currency or U.S. Dollars, you should consider factors that impact the total cost to send or the amount available after transfer, such as exchange rates and other fees.
Footnote 
 Merrill waives its commissions for all online stock, ETF and option trades placed in a Merrill Edge¬Æ Self-Directed brokerage account. Brokerage fees associated with, but not limited to, margin transactions, special stock registration/gifting, account transfer and processing and termination apply. $0 option trades are subject to a $0.65 per-contract fee. Other fees and restrictions may apply. Pricing is subject to change without advance notice.
Footnote 
 Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options. Before engaging in the purchase or sale of options, investors should understand the nature of and extent of their rights and obligations and be aware of the risks involved in investing with options. Please read the options disclosure document titled ""Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options (PDF)"" before considering any option transaction. You may also call the Investment Center at 877.653.4732 for a copy. A separate client agreement is needed. Multi-leg option orders are charged one base commission per order, plus a per-contract charge.  
The maximum loss, gain and breakeven of any options strategy only remains as defined so long as the strategy contains all original positions. Trading, rolling, assignment, or exercise of any portion of the strategy will result in a new maximum loss, gain and breakeven calculation, which will be materially different from the calculation when the strategy remains intact with all of the contemplated legs or positions. This is applicable to all options strategies inclusive of long options, short options and spreads. 
Long options are exercised and short options are assigned. Note that American-style options can be assigned/exercised at any time through the day of expiration without prior notice. Options can be assigned/exercised after market close on expiration day. 
Supporting documentation for any claims, comparison, recommendations, statistics, or other technical data, will be supplied upon request.
 
Footnote 3 Exercise and assignment of cash settled options are subject to a $0.65 per-contract fee. Trades commissions for trades placed with a representative will not exceed 75% of trade amount.
Footnote 
 Mutual Funds: While no-load funds do not assess sales charges, fund shares are subject to management fees and certain other expenses. Redemption fees may also apply. Merrill Lynch receives remuneration from participating fund companies. In addition to receiving dealer concessions and asset-based sales charges and/or services fees in connection with clients' purchasing and holding mutual fund shares, Merrill Lynch and its affiliates provide other services for which they may receive additional compensation from funds or their affiliates. This compensation is generally disclosed in a fund's prospectus which is available from an Investment Center representative and in the Guide to Mutual Fund Investing (PDF). For specific mutual fund family compensation information, please contact the Investment Center.
Footnote 
 Fixed Income: Fixed income orders contain order information on Agency Discounts/Notes/Bonds, Certificates of Deposit, Corporate Bonds, Municipal Bonds and Treasury Bond investment vehicles.
Footnote 
 Exchange Traded Funds are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Investment returns may fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Footnote 
 A Brokered Certificate of Deposit is different than a bank Certificate of Deposit. It is sold for a bank by a broker while a Certificate of Deposit can be purchased directly from a bank. Brokered CDs may offer higher rates of return, but their value may fluctuate with changing interest rates. Banking products are provided by Bank of America, N.A. and affiliated banks. Members FDIC and wholly owned subsidiaries of Bank of America Corporation.
Footnote 
 When you purchase securities, you may pay for the securities in full, or if your account has been established as a margin account with the margin lending program, you may borrow part of the purchase price from Merrill. If you choose to borrow funds for your purchase, Merrill's collateral for the loan will be the securities purchased, other assets in your margin account, and your assets in any other accounts at Merrill. If the securities in your margin account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan, and, as a result, we can take action, such as to issue a margin call and/or sell securities in any of your accounts held with us, in order to maintain the required equity in your account. If your account has a Visa¬Æ card and/or checks, you may also create a margin debit if your withdrawals (by Visa card, checks, preauthorized debits, FTS or other transfers) exceed the sum of any available free credit balances plus available money account balances (such as bank deposit balances or money market funds). Please refer to your account documents for more information. 
Before opening a margin account, you should carefully review the terms governing margin loans. For Individual Investor Accounts, these terms are contained in the Margin Lending Program Client Agreement. For all other accounts, the terms are in your account agreement and disclosures. It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in using margin. These risks include the following:
 
 You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. A decline in the value of securities that are bought on margin may require you to provide additional funds to us to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities in your account(s).
 We can force the sale of securities in your account(s). If the equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements or Merrill's higher ""house"" requirements, we can sell the securities in any of your accounts held by us to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for any shortfall in the account after such as sale.
 We can sell your securities without contacting you. Some investors mistakenly believe that they must be contacted for a margin call to be valid, and that securities in their accounts cannot be liquidated to meet the call unless they are contacted first. This is not the case. We will attempt to notify you of margin calls, but we are not required to do so. Even if we have contacted you and provided a specific date by which you can meet a margin call, we can still take necessary steps to protect our financial interests, including immediately selling the securities without notice to you.
 You are not entitled to choose which securities in your account(s) are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. Because the securities are collateral for the margin loan, we have the right to decide which security to sell in order to protect our interests.
 We can increase our ""house"" maintenance margin requirements at any time and are not required to provide you advance written notice. These changes in our policy may take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the call may cause us to liquidate or sell securities in your account(s).
 You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. While an extension of time to meet margin requirements may be available to you under certain conditions, you don't have a right to the extension.
 
If you have any questions or concerns about margin and the margin lending program, please contact the Merrill Investment Center at 855.332.5920.

It takes just a minute to get a head‚Äëstart with investing
If you're not feeling confident about where to begin, relax! We have you covered. These quick videos can give you a head-start with opening, funding and investing from your Merrill account.
How to Choose &amp; Open an Account
 Disclosure: 
Please see important information at the end of this video.
When you first start investing, it can be a really exciting time. But just in case you're also feeling a bit overwhelmed‚Ä¶ you're not alone. Most people feel that way at first.
But you only have to make two decisions before opening your account.
You choose what kind of account is right for you‚Ä¶ and how much guidance you want for that account.
Sounds doable, right? I'll go through it on my screen and show you exactly where to find the information you need.
Okay, so most people are either going to select a general investing account‚Ä¶ or one of Merrill's Individual Retirement accounts, also known as IRAs.
If you're focused on retirement, start here and take a look at ""Compare IRAs"" to understand the different options. Or you can even try Merrill's IRA selector tool if that works better for you.
If you aren't looking at retirement right now, Merrill has general investing accounts that offer more flexibility to take out money before you retire.
You just decide if it'll be in your name alone, or a joint account. And if you're opening it for someone under 18, you need to make it a ""custodial"" account.
One thing to keep in mind, if you're moving any assets from another investment company, the easiest thing to do is to create the same kind of account with Merrill. Anything else can impact your taxes.
Now, if you have assets from an old job or 401k, there are other things to consider. But either way, Merrill has experienced people who can help you, and they're available 24/7.
Okay, once you've decided what kind account you want to open, you can pick how you want to work with Merrill.
Would you rather go with your own investment ideas, or have one of Merrill's professionals manage and invest your account for you?
Let me tell you a bit about both choices.
If you want to be the one steering your own investments, Merrill Edge Self-Directed may be the way to go. This choice gives all kinds of access to flexible tools, research and expert insights to help you implement your investing ideas.

If you aren't so interested in being a hands-on investor, you might decide on Merrill Guided Investing. You just answer a few questions online and Merrill will recommend a strategy and manage the investments for you.
With this option, you pay a monthly program fee and that covers investing and management. You can even choose to work directly with an advisor.
So, once you choose your account type and how you want to work with Merrill, it's time to actually open the account. You can do it all from your computer, or even your phone.
And if you're already a Bank of America client, use that log-in and it'll pre-fill most of your application.
Once you get email confirmation that your account is live, you can fund it and start trading from any device. But don't worry‚Ä¶ we have other videos and plenty of support as you move along.
So, don't feel overwhelmed. You're just a few decisions and couple clicks away from building your financial future with Merrill. And that's pretty exciting. Thank you for watching.

 Preferred Rewards Program Eligibility. You can enroll, and maintain your membership, in the Bank of America Preferred Rewards¬Æ program if you have an active, eligible personal checking account with Bank of America¬Æ and maintain the balance required for one of the balance tiers.

Balances include your combined, qualifying Bank of America deposit accounts (such as checking, savings, certificate of deposit) and/or your Merrill investment accounts (such as Cash Management Accounts, 529 Plans). You can satisfy the combined balance requirement for enrollment with either: 
a three-month combined average daily balance in your qualifying deposit and investment accounts, or
a current combined balance, provided that you enroll at the time you open your first eligible personal checking account and satisfy the balance requirement at the end of at least one day within 30 days of opening that account.

Eligibility to enroll is generally available three or more business days after the end of the calendar month in which you satisfy the requirements. Benefits become effective within 30 days of your enrollment, or for new accounts within 30 days of account opening, unless we indicate otherwise. Bank of America Private Bank clients qualify to enroll in the Diamond Tier regardless of balance and may qualify for the Diamond Honors tier based on their qualifying Bank of America, Merrill and Private Bank balances.

If there are multiple owners on this account, the information you provide should reflect the views and circumstances of all owners on the account. If you are the fiduciary of this account for the benefit of the account owner or account holder (e.g., trustee for a trust or custodian for an UTMA), please keep in mind that these assets will be invested for the benefit of the account owner or account holder. Merrill Guided Investing is offered with and without an advisor. Merrill, Merrill Lynch, and/or Merrill Edge investment advisory programs are offered by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Incorporated (""MLPF&amp;S"") and Managed Account Advisors LLC (""MAA"") an affiliate of MLPF&amp;S.

Discounts are only available on auto loan applications submitted by you directly to Bank of America through its website, Financial Centers, or Bank call centers. Discounts are not available for motor vehicle leases or for applications sourced from car dealerships, car manufacturers, or third-party branded/co-branded relationships. Benefit is non-transferable.

 Footnote    Preferred Rewards First Mortgage. The origination fee reduction and/or interest rate reductions are offered to clients who are enrolled or are eligible to enroll in Preferred Rewards, based on their rewards tier at the submittal of a mortgage loan application to Bank of America, N.A. for a new purchase or refinance loan (for co-borrowers, at least one applicant must be enrolled or eligible to enroll). The rewards tier is not subject to adjustment after the application is submitted. The origination fee reduction ($200 for Gold tier, $400 for Platinum tier and $600 for Platinum Honors tier) will not exceed the amount of the Lender Origination Fee. In order to receive the full Diamond and Diamond Honors interest rate reduction (0.25% for Diamond tier and 0.375% for Diamond Honors tier) the client must be approved for an eligible loan and enroll in PayPlan, our automatic payment service, designating an eligible Bank of America checking or savings account. To allow us to apply and disclose the interest rate reduction and close the loan timely, we encourage Diamond and Diamond Honors tier clients to enroll in PayPlan as soon as possible and prior to the expected loan closing date. PayPlan is not available on VA and FHA products and Diamond and Diamond Honors tier clients closing loans without PayPlan enrollment receive a 0.125% interest rate reduction benefit. For adjustable rate mortgages (except PrimeFirst¬Æ), the discounts are applied to the interest rate only during the initial fixed-rate period. For PrimeFirst¬Æ adjustable rate mortgages, the discount is applied to the margin and cannot reduce the margin below 0%. Some Preferred Rewards benefits cannot be combined with other offers. All mortgage interest rate reduction offers may be subject to a maximum interest rate reduction limit. For further details, Refer to the Preferred Rewards section of the Personal Schedule of Fees. Preferred Rewards benefits are non-transferable and are not available with Custom Residential Real Estate financing.
 Footnote    Credit Card Preferred Rewards Bonus. Certain credit cards are eligible to receive a Bank of America Preferred Rewards¬Æ bonus. Enrolled Preferred Rewards members with eligible Bank of America¬Æ credit cards can receive a Preferred Rewards bonus of 25% for the Gold tier, 50% for the Platinum tier, or 75% for the Platinum Honors, Diamond or Diamond Honors tier on each purchase. If your card receives the 10% customer bonus, the Preferred Rewards bonus will replace the 10% customer bonus. You will not receive the Preferred Rewards bonus when you redeem your Cash Rewards or Points. The Preferred Rewards bonus for eligible cash rewards credit cards will be applied after all base and bonus cash rewards have been calculated on a purchase. For example, a $100 purchase that earns 3% ($3.00) will actually earn $3.75, $4.50 or $5.25 based on your tier when the purchase posts to your account. For all other eligible card types, a purchase that earns 100 base points will actually earn 125, 150, or 175 points, based on your tier when the purchase posts to your account. The Preferred Rewards bonus is not applied to any account opening bonus, if applicable. The Preferred Rewards bonus also does not apply to the bonus earn for certain programs. This information can be found in the Program Rules associated with those credit cards. Other terms and conditions apply. Please refer to your card's Program Rules for details about how you will receive the Preferred Rewards Bonus. Program Rules are mailed upon account opening and are accessible through the rewards redemption site via Online Banking or by calling the number on the back of your card.
